<p>About a week into the public beta, we will seek out members who are deeply engaged in the community’s development; members who:</p>

<ul>
<li>Have a reasonably high reputation score to indicate active, consistent participation.</li>
<li>Show an interest in their meta’s community-building activities.</li>
<li>Lead by example, showing patience and respect for their fellow community members in everything they write.</li>
<li>Exhibit those intangible traits discussed in A Theory of Moderation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Bonus points for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Members with participation in both meta and the parent site (i.e. interest in both community building and expertise in the field).</li>
<li>Area 51 participation, social network referrals, or blogging about the site.</li>
<li>Members who have already shown an interest or ability to promote their community.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>This is the basic structure of a Moderator nomination thread:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Each nomination should be a separate answer. Link the name to the user’s profile (parent and meta) so we can see their activity.</li>
<li>The nominee should indicate their acceptance by editing the answer, adding that they accept the nomination. Optionally they can write something about themselves.</li>
<li>Self nominations are okay, and even encouraged. Most sites have not had sufficient time for many users to stand out. Self nomination is simply a way to say, “I’m interested. Let my record speak for itself.” Links to other activities may be helpful: Area 51 participation, participation in other sites, blog posts reviewing or announcing the site, etc.</li>
<li>Include the bullet points (from above) to show what we are looking for.</li>

16,3,,2,,10,15,,,3,,,,,CC BY-SA 2.5,"<p>This is an excellent question.  I struggled with this when I was launching the StackExchange 1.0 version of the site.  I never did settle on an answer, but here's how I was leaning:</p>

<p><em>Some</em> limited types of questions that are small-business-related <em>could</em> be on-topic as ""personal finance.""</p>

<p>For instance, some questions related to being a <strong>contractor, self-employed, independent, freelancer,</strong> etc. (whatever you call it) ought to be <strong>on-topic</strong>, because they relate to a <em>fundamental</em> decision all individuals have to make:  ""How will I make a living?""  Traditional employment is but one way to make a living, and to only allow people to talk about their employment income to the exclusion of other forms of income would be prejudicial.  There are other forms of making a living and I think they can be explored.  Even trust-fund brats could come and ask trust-fund brat questions  :-)</p>

<p>On the other hand, I think if a questions relates more to the how-to-run-a-business side of things, or clearly to larger businesses (i.e. obviously not one-man-shops), then the question could be considered off-topic.</p>

<p><strong>Of course, I have to confess a bias:</strong> I am an independent contractor, and not an employee.  Consequently, I want to be able to talk about being self-employed, how it affects my finances, etc. :-D</p>

21,3,,2,,4,20,,,1,,,,,CC BY-SA 2.5,"<p>I say feel free to modify them if you think you can make them better questions.</p>

<p>BTW, they were added by a human being &ndash; <strong>me</strong> &ndash; based on questions I saw in Google search analytics.  There's no automated process to pull the questions ... it was just something I was doing to add some questions to the site when things were slow.  Stack Exchange 1.0 did not have a large group of committed beta users standing by to post interesting questions ;-)</p>

<p>Anyway, in some cases the ""Web Search User"" questions were word-for-word from the search analytics (with spelling or capitalization corrections only), and in others I expanded very slightly, but without trying to guess too much what the question was really trying to get at, or otherwise editorialize.  But maybe some community insight could make them better questions.  I see no reason why we shouldn't edit them.</p>

<p>Though: why do you think they're off-topic?  Contractor vs. employee: I think those are on-topic because understanding how individuals choose or arrange to earn income should be included in ""personal finance and money"" (Within reason: should keep <em>""Make $$$$ at home in your spare time!""</em> scams away...?)</p>

  <ul>
  <li><p>Average working people looking to attain financial literacy and find
  ways to save their money, minimize
  their taxes (legitimately), invest
  their savings wisely, plan for their
  childrens' education savings, plan for
  their retirement, etc.</p></li>
  <li><p>Already financially-savvy individuals and do-it-yourself

  <li><p>Financial planning professionals such as <strong>Certified Financial Planners,

<p>One of the strategies I believe in is in developing quality content: Well-titled, well-described questions with high quality answers.  Good content helps the site succeed in search results, and being found and noticed for quality content encourages people to bookmark, visit again, ask a question, etc.</p>

<p>But, good content aside, how <em>else</em> can we reach out to experts in personal finance, or people with questions on the subject, and get them to participate at the site?</p>

Nominees wanted.,<discussion><moderators>,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>In reference to the <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/11/moderator-election"">moderator election</a>, first, thank you all for your support so far. <strong>:-D</strong><br>
Now, to the point of my question:</p>

<p>Last year, when I started <em>basicallymoney.com</em> &ndash; (the Stack Exchange 1.0 site that was <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/59672/questions-on-beta-sites-are-way-older-than-they-should-be"">transmogrified</a> into this SE 2.0 site, and which <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/4/what-should-we-use-as-a-domain-name"">may sport that name again</a>) &ndash; my plan was to <strong>build a money Q&amp;A site that was inclusive and supportive of people from multiple countries.</strong></p>

<p>Why?  Because there's so much knowledge to share about saving money, cutting costs, investing, etc. that crosses geographical boundaries.  Where boundaries matter in subjects like taxes, retirement account types, etc. our <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/tags"">tags</a> support the endeavour.  Overall, I think we're better off together than apart.</p>

<p>(Consider <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/"">Stack Overflow</a>, where Java, C#, Python, etc. developers can participate on the same site, with <em>many</em> questions of interest to all, while others specific to a choice of technology.  Works, right?)</p>

<p><strong>It was also part of my plan to have moderators that represent such a diverse user base.</strong><br>
If the site has a lot of U.S. users and questions, a lot of Canadian users and questions, a lot of British users and questions, etc., then how about having moderators drawn from each group who can recognize, tag, organize, and edit questions that may be region-specific?  So:</p>

<p><strong>I'd like to make an appeal for interested users to nominate themselves for moderator.</strong>  </p>

<p>Both <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/users/19/zephyr"">Zephyr</a> and <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/users/3/chris-w-rea"">myself</a> are Canadian.  We gladly accept our nominations.  But, there aren't yet any American or British nominees for moderator.  IMHO, those are gaps that should be filled ... and there will be other gaps as the site grows.  Australia? Ireland?  India?</p>

<p><strong>So... who is interested in nominating themselves for the job?</strong>  <strong>If so, <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/11/moderator-election"">please do so <em>here</em></a>.</strong></p>

Okay, my initial wording was poor.  I didn't really mean to ask whether I should be specific; the answer to that is obviously yes.

That's a clue to people answering that you're soliciting information pertinent to your location, and it will help prevent people from answering for any location.  If you want to err on the side of providing a location tag, that's fine - if it doesn't really apply, somebody may remove the tag.</p>

<p>The point is:  It's <strong>your</strong> question, so make it pertinent to <strong>your</strong> circumstances.  That's the way to get answers that are most useful to you and others in the same circumstances.  Specific questions and specific answers are good.</p>

<p>If somebody else is interested in asking a <em>similar</em> question, but for another country perhaps, or with another different twist, they're free to do that, and if there's something <em>different</em> in what they are asking, that's also a good question.  (But if it's a 100% duplicate, it is likely to get closed.)</p>

65,3,-1,2,,3,64,,,2,,,,,CC BY-SA 2.5,"<p>Titles <em>should</em> ideally be questions.</p>

<p>But, more important is ensuring a question title contains adequate keywords <em>relevant</em> to the question to make the question a more likely search result in Google.</p>

<p>In your first case above, for instance, I might re-title it ""Online data source or web site for forward foreign exchange rate quotes?""</p>

<p><strong>A good title with the right keywords can often mean the difference between only dozens of search visitors, or <em>tens of thousands</em>.</strong>  Case in point, this question got 55,000+ pageviews:</p>

<p><a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/1224/ontario-harmonized-sales-tax-hst-transition-benefit-rebate-cheques-osttb-who"">Ontario harmonized sales tax (HST) transition benefit rebate cheques / OSTTB: Who, when, how much?</a></p>

<p>The title above recognizes that individuals search on a variety of things:</p>

<ul>
<li>""hst rebate cheque""</li>
<li>""osttb cheque""</li>
<li>""harmonized sales tax cheque""</li>
<li>""ontario hst cheque""</li>
<li>""hst cheque how much""</li>
</ul>

<p>So prefer verbose titles rich in keywords to short, terse titles.  The question words are sometimes good search terms so they can help too.  You'd be surprised (or not) how many people just type an English question into the Google search box!</p>

<p>The basic answer being be prepared.  That said, there are at least two levels to this and so depends on the question itself.  </p>

<p>One way to prepare is with financial instruments, i.e. savings account, cold hard cash, foreign currencies.</p>

<p>Another way, is the full-on crap hitting the fan situation.  I.e. my plan includes stockpiling some food, boning up on my ""survival"" skills, boning up on my other skills, e.g. home repair, sewing, skills useful in a serious doom scenario.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>I'm torn.  I don't want to see a bunch of doom-and-gloom, buy-guns-and-ammo type questions.  That said, I feel that the possible collapse of the financial system, however remote, <em>is</em> an appropriate topic for a finance site.  Let's not forget that financial panics were a regular thing before the establishment of the Federal Reserve.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Disclaimer: I personally believe that financial collapse is a real possibility, I'm just not sure there is much to say about it besides be prepared. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>With this in mind, I have been thinking that one question could serve as the canonical Q&amp;A for this topic.  As C. Ross puts it, there isn't much to be said other than ""be prepared.""  </p>

<p>Of course, there are several key <em>financial</em> ideas that go into being prepared:</p>

<ol>
<li>Inflation may render cash/money next to worthless.</li>
<li>Even that gold held for you in a vault somewhere may be next to worthless if you cannot actually get access to it.  Not to mention that in a worst case scenario, who will really care about shiny baubles (at least in the immediate term)? </li>
<li>Bartering (of goods and services) will likely be king for the immediate term, in a worst case scenario.  Even in a less than doom-and-gloom scenario, bartering may become important.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let's not forget that preparing for ""Oh, crap!"" scenarios is a part of financial planning.  Like it or not, finance is a key part of life.  In the absence of good financial systems, human productivity, innovation and general quality of life can seriously suffer.</p>

<p>(Ultimately, that is why I like finance.  In reality, it is not just about numbers in a spreadsheet.  It truly is a multidisciplinary, human-centric pursuit.)</p>

I was relaxing indoors after a family day at the beach, spending time browsing &amp; answering questions at <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com"" rel=""nofollow"">stackoverflow.com</a> and <a href=""http://superuser.com"" rel=""nofollow"">superuser.com</a>. I realized it would be great if there were the same kind of Q&amp;A site, but about <strong>money</strong> instead of technology.  Technology is one of my passions -- and <strong>personal finance</strong> the other.</p>

<p>Rather than wait for somebody else to build the community I was looking for, I decided to act.  I requested access to the StackExchange hosted platform beta, which had been recently announced.  StackExchange is based on the same successful software used to run the above sites.</p>

<p>What do I like about the StackExchange platform?  Let me list some of the reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <em>community</em> decides which questions and answers are good, and which are not, since:</li>
<li>Questions <strong>and</strong> answers can be either <em>upvoted</em> or <em>downvoted</em> by registered users.</li>
<li>Users can gain <em>reputation</em> by asking good questions, or providing good answers.</li>
<li>The system supports organizing questions and finding answers thruogh a tagging system.</li>
<li>The web site software is a joy to use!</li>

<p>While I think <em>some</em> business questions could be on-topic &ndash; e.g. relating to <em>self-employment</em>, as being close to the individual / personal end of the spectrum &ndash; I do think questions about business practices in general and in larger companies should be off-topic, <strong>unless those practices directly impact one's <em>personal finances</em> and it is that impact that is being asked about.</strong></p>

<p>For instance, a question asking about a company's across-the-board salary reductions may be on topic if an individual is asking how to cope with that.  Or, even a question about ""how can I negotiate my salary in a company where salaries are public knowledge?""  The subject matter is related to the question under the microscope in this case, but asking about the practice from an <em>individual's</em> perspective.  I'd say that would work here.</p>

<p>But in this case as it is written, the question seems to be asking <strong>""what's better for the company?""</strong> .. So I don't see the personal finance angle.  I'm sure there'll be a Stack Exchange 2.0 site for business practices, at some point.  Belongs there.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>assuming the user a) has an email b) has opted in to email FOR THAT QUESTION.. so it'd still be quite rare

<p>June 2016 edit from JoeTaxpayer -</p>

<p>This question is nearly 6 years old, before I became a Mod, and can use a refresh. Recently 3 questions were posted regarding Banktivity, PF software that I hadn't heard of. 3 questions from one member, over a single day. </p>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>I'm adding this here in response to Chris' question above ""Should we revisit this as we get more examples..."" 
These questions first came to my attention via flag, a member notifying the mods of these 3 question posted one after the other. I still don't know the popularity of this software, but in my opinion, this gave the appearance of spam, trying to promote the software itself. Chris' point that we haven't seen this as too big an issue is correct, 6 years and no new discussion. Still I think this is worth looking at again. </p>

I had written the following comment to try and show why there <strong>is</strong> a personal finance angle to questions such as that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A basic understanding of government
  taxation and spending may help an
  individual understand their role as a
  taxpayer. Also, if an individual were
  to invest in government bonds (as many
  do) an understanding of how government
  revenues and costs should balance (or
  don't) ought to help one make better
  investing decisions. So I see an angle
  for this - but like I said, I'll let
  the community decide.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think what we want to avoid are <em>economics or policy questions that are at an <strong>advanced academic or professional level</em></strong>.  When I posted the sample question at Area 51, that's what I was going for.  I didn't mean to prevent any and all questions about economics.  An advanced discussion of what the Fed should or shouldn't do in a recession is quite different from a person asking ""why is the government cutting costs?"" </p>

<p>The question is: Where do we draw the line at what constitutes basic vs. advanced economics or policy?</p>

151,366,,2,,7,148,,,5,,,,,CC BY-SA 2.5,"<p>I think the best thing for now would be to accept any questions, but agree a line with the economics stackexchange if that gets set up, and transfer questions as appropriate. If the consequence of being over the line is just a transfer rather than closure, it'll be much less important to define it precisely.</p>

It can range from choosing to start a business to understanding the macro- and micro-economic environment in which to do so.  A person who starts their career managing student debt may become someone who starts their own business or wishes to manage a fairly substantive investment portfolio.</p>

<p>I think there needs to be an awareness of overlap but I also think that purely ""academic"" questions which may come up can be migrated when the time comes.</p>

<p>Instead, <strong>let's start with a killer &quot;elevator pitch!&quot;</strong> Joel will be blogging about the elevator pitch approach to naming, but to get you started:</p>
<h2>The Elevator Pitch</h2>
<p>This isn't as easy as it sounds. Imagine the user who will never read your FAQ and you have two seconds to grab their attention. It should be catchy but descriptive. It should be thoroughly clear but painfully concise. <strong>Make every... word... count.</strong></p>
<p>Here are some creative examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""http://gawker.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gawker</a>: Daily Manhattan media news and gossip. Reporting live from the center of the universe.</li>
<li><a href=""http://gizmodo.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gizmodo</a>: The gadget guide. So much in love with shiny new toys, it’s unnatural.</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.autoblog.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Autoblog</a>: We obsessively cover the auto industry.</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.dumblittleman.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DumbLittleMan</a>: So what do we do here? Well, it’s simple. 15 to 20 times per week we provide tips that will save you money, increase your productivity, or simply keep you sane.</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.needcoffee.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Needcoffee.com</a>: We are the Internet equivalent of a triple espresso with whipped cream. Mmmm…whipped cream.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Use it as a Tagline</h2>
<p>A shorter elevator pitch <em>can</em> be used as a tagline — something you can display in the header at the top of the page. If it doesn't fit, consider shortening it or creating a separate tagline. Here are some great examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""http://slashdot.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Slashdot</a>: News for nerds. Stuff that matters.</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.lifehacker.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lifehacker</a>: Don’t live to geek, geek to live!</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.thesimpledollar.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Simple Dollar</a>: Financial talk for the rest of us.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Motto (don't forget your logo)</h2>
<p>A logo begs for it own little, short tagline — like a motto. Maybe the tagline inspires the logo; Maybe it's the other way around. Mottos make good t-shirt, bumper stickers, and other marketing material. Either way, you'll recognize a good motto when you see it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Just do it.</li>
<li>Think Different.</li>
<li>The Uncola.</li>
<li>Intel inside.</li>
<li>Like a rock.</li>
<li>The king of beers.</li>
</ul>
<p>…and perhaps all this leads to a proper name and domain for your site… <em>eventually</em>. So let's start from the basics. <strong>Come up with a killer elevator pitch, tagline, and/or motto!</strong></p>

<p>I didn't like the feel of China one, or the one about the government spending. It's hard for me to place exactly why this is, but at a certain point I think things moved along from ""help me understand how this affects my finances"" along to ""help me understand this critique of US policy which is relevant to the economy at large but not otherwise directly relevant to my finances"" and finally ended up distressingly close to ""help me critique US economic policy"".</p>

<p>Part of the problem here is that people sometimes choose short, general/high-level titles for their questions, e.g. ""X vs. Y""... whereas, question titles can and should be complete sentences containing relevant keywords (e.g. ""What are the tax benefits of X vs. Y"")</p>

<p>Where there are multiple accepted answers,  the accepted answer of the merge target remains the accepted answer.  Generally speaking, the merge target should be chosen on the merits of the question.  Where two questions are of equal quality, the older question should be the target of the merge.  Exceptions should be noted in a comment to the question, as should the implications of the merge.  This is important in order to not alienate members of the community by futzing with the questions.</p>

<p>Continuing on that topic, care should be taken with decisions to merge questions.  I know I feel a strong sense of ownership to my answers (and the few questions I ask).  However, we must also keep in mind that the point of SE sites is to have good questions and answers for now and the future.  Having useful answers split across multiple questions hinders the goal of having good reference material on these sites.</p>

<p>Along these lines we should not worry too much about losing 15 rep points for accepted answers losing that status due to a merge.  Overall, it is a small amount of rep and usually less then the rep from upvotes.  A merged question should benefit from increased visibility, though -- of course -- there could be more competition.</p>

<p>It's helpful: </p>

<p>% If you're asking questions about a site, letting people visit the 
 site is more effective than any number of words and screenshots. </p>

<p>It's polite: </p>

<p>% When asking a question, you want to do as much for potential 
 answerers as possible. Forcing them to create an account (often 
 requires giving out an email address, which some people dislike) and 
 then configure the account properly (not trivial in many cases) is a 
 lot more work for them than giving them to access to an 
 existing properly-configured account. </p>

<p>It's effective: </p>

<p>% The more work a question requires, the fewer answers it will 
 receive. Filling out a form, waiting for email confirmation, and 
 configuring an account just to <em>start</em> on the problem is a lot of 
 work, and certainly discourages people from casually browsing to see 
 if they can help. </p>

<p>It usually doesn't violate TOS: </p>

<p>% Many websites ask you to insure your account isn't accessed by 
 ""unauthorized parties"" or that ""you are responsible for access to 
 your account"". However, posting account information on stackexchange 
 sites means that you are authorizing stackexchange readers to access 
 your account and are accepting responsibility for their access to 
 your account. </p>

<p>It's legal: </p>

<p>% Generally, I can transfer any rights I have under a site's TOS to 
 others. Some sites' TOS forbid transferring access, but these are 
 generally sites that provide access to things of value such as 
 pictures, movies, songs, etc. </p>

<p>It's on-label use: </p>

<p>% Demonstration accounts often exist to help users understand how a 
 site works. Anything that helps the user understand how a site works 
 (or whether to sign up for a real account), including having 
 stackexchange users visit the site and offer their opinions, is a 
 legitimate use of a demonstration account. </p>

<p>It's ethical: </p>

<p>% Since any stackexchange user could get a demonstration account 
 anyway, the site is in no way harmed if someone uses an existing 
 demonstration account. Providing access to an existing account is 
 simply a convenience and a shortcut, not a method of providing 
 illegitimate access. </p>

<p>Of course, the above doesn't apply to all sites. For example, a site 
that provides demonstration accounts only to people meeting a certain 
criteria may not want other people accessing the site. </p>

<p>However, the notes above apply to many sites, and a blanket ban would 
be overkill and do more harm than good. </p>

<p>Financial planning is more than <em>saying</em> ""be prepared."" It's that <em>how</em> that these questions are asking about.</p>

<p>Nobody is asking you to predict the future (or at least they shouldn't be). But <strong>mitigating  risk</strong> against possible down-turns is very much a part of ""personal finance &amp; money."" I don't think you can reasonably deter questions which ask you to speculate about <em>potential</em> outcomes, good or bad (emphasis on the word <em>potential</em>). That speculation forms the the very <em>basis</em> of investing and financial planning.</p>

<p>You may think that ""stockpiling nickels"" is silly&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;asking for assurances that it is going to pay off is certainly speculation and off-topic&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;but asking if it is a valid financial activity is certainly very much on topic for this site&hellip; even more so in an economic downturn when so many people are concerned about which activities are likely to afford some protection.</p>

217,414,,2,,5,209,,,2,,,,,CC BY-SA 2.5,"<p>I'm strongly against the notion that there's a canonical answer to this kind of question.</p>

<p><strong>The answer to ""Am I investing correctly?"" is as individual as the person asking the question.</strong>  A lot of these questions <em>appear</em> the same because (a) the people asking the questions don't provide enough background data to get good specific answers from others and (b) the people answering the questions don't regularly test their assumptions about the person asking the question by asking for clarification.</p>

<p>Providing a generic answer to something like ""What should I invest in if I'm going to retire in 40 years?"" like ""Buy and hold Vanguard index funds because of low fees, lots of time horizon, blah blah blah"" is easy, but it's also dangerous (isn't that what everyone says to do anyway?) and a bit lazy (i.e. it's the kind of sanctioned, sterilized, vetted investment advice that will make it less likely that a CFP will be sued).</p>

<p>We should be able to do better than pointing people to an Investment FAQ.</p>

<p>A good start for what people should provide if what they want is a good answer to ""Am I investing correctly?"" is</p>

<ul>
<li>Age</li>
<li>Marital status</li>
<li>Net worth (not including house)</li>
<li>Current asset allocation</li>
<li>Location (country, possibly state)</li>
<li>Annual income</li>
<li>Occupation</li>
<li>#1 goal</li>
</ul>

<p>If asking for this is too intrusive, or if we don't want the potential liability of providing unlicensed financial advice, <em>then we should just make these kinds of questions off-topic.</em>  Or, make the canonical answer this:</p>

<p><strong>""These kinds of specific questions should be addressed by one or more competent financial advisors who are able to consider your financial picture, in detail, as a whole.""</strong></p>

<p>But, again, I don't feel it's right to point people to generic investment advice, because we don't need to be yet another echo chamber for the status quo.</p>

While I enjoy the subject of finance, particularly investing quite a bit, I think the subject is a bit of a departure from other Stack sites I have visited. In StackOverflow or SuperUser, questions are quite objective. There may be a few ways to approach a programming problem, but in the end it's easy to see that they work (or do not). 
In personal finance, there are a whole slew of questions that can not be definitively answered. Particularly those questions that involve predictions of the economy or a certain investment. The thread for those question could just go on and on with no definitive answer in site. Some of these questions (where is Stock X going?) may be the most interesting to people. This seems contrary to the general intent of stack site, which is to avoid unanswerable questions. </p>

<p>There are plenty of answerable questions. What is a stock, what is a bond, what are the tax advantages to investment X, what is the difference between types of mortgages.</p>

<p>What is a good way of sorting unanswerable questions from answerable ones.

  <h3>What kind of questions should I not ask here?</h3>
  
  <p>You should only ask practical, answerable questions based on actual problems that you face. Chatty, open-ended questions diminish the usefulness of our site and push other questions off the front page. To prevent your question from being flagged and possibly removed, avoid asking subjective questions where …</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>every answer is equally valid: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your favorite _____?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>your answer is provided along with the question, and you expect more answers: &ldquo;I use _____ for _____, what do you use?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>there is no actual problem to be solved: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m curious if other people feel like I do.&rdquo;</li>
  <li>we are being asked an open-ended, hypothetical question: &ldquo;What if _____ happened?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>it is a rant disguised as a question: &ldquo;_____ sucks, am I right?&rdquo;</li></li>
  </ul>

<p>Specifically on the three questions you list:</p>

<p><a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/6015/country-budget-cuts"">Country Budget Cuts</a> - I agree and closed as off topic.  As written, it was open-ended, hypothetical, not about personal finance, and had no real answer.</p>

<p><a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/6008/does-the-fractional-reserve-banking-system-necessitate-indefinite-and-exponential"">Does the fractional reserve banking system necessitate indefinite and exponential economic growth?</a> - This question is a ""real"" question that will have a ""real"" answer.  I'd like to close this one as it is not about personal finance.  However, I'd like to see more close votes from the community to help build consensus before closing.</p>

<p><a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/5828/relationship-between-silver-and-gold-prices-historically"">Relationship between gold and silver historically</a>  - I think this should stay open.   This is valuable to a personal investor for asset allocation. Whether two assets typically track together or separate seems like an investment type question that would benefit.  </p>

<li>Credit card terms and conditions.  </li>

<p><strong>Fine print is everywhere when people transact.

Will there be ambiguity sometimes? Certainly.</p>

<p>What do I think we <em>should</em> do?  We should have a disclaimer on the site that answers may not constitute professional legal or financial advice, and that individual professional advice should be sought, especially for the important matters.

Unfortunately, I'm not a lawyer and insurance is regulated at the state level, so it may vary across the US.  I just realized that the question does not mention a location, which would actually be pertinent to a specific answer.  However, that is missing the forest for the trees.</p>

<p>Not one person answering the question brought up this issue.  Rather, they focused on what I think is the heart of the matter: responsibility and obligation.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I voted to open the question because I saw someone concerned about a debt.  Yes, there are legal questions that most of us cannot answer.  Yes, there may be conflicting opinions.  However there are principles on which we all seem to agree.  The answer to the question is basically discussing those principles (responsibility and obligation).</p>

243,2636,,2,,3,232,,,0,,,,,CC BY-SA 2.5,"<p>As the asker of the question I think I should give my perspective.  The question was two parts.  First, is there legal protection for me if the doctor does not file the claim on time where they were expected to.  Second, if there is no protection how do I handle negotiating dealing with the billing people to mitigate my personal losses.  Both were answered reasonably well.  Yes I have an obligation, and yes I can probably negotiate at least a smaller payment if not getting it dismissed.</p>

<p>We have insurance to protect us against losses. The insurance was under obligation to pay those.  Should I get pay the bill and get reimbursed or not?  These are all issues of money.  Dealing with insurance, how to deal, and when to deal with them is certainly a matter of personal finance.</p>

<p>Excluding legal issues should not happen.  Much of financial management is dealing with avoiding taxes. If you exclude everything that deals with taxes there is not much of a site left.  Legal issues should be excluded if they do not deal with financial issues at their core.</p>

<p>In summary, I think that an acceptable answer could be conditioned with seek out a lawyers/tax-attorney opinion.  That is a legitimate answer and not ""off-topic"" per se.</p>

<p>The ""country budget cuts"" makes a bunch of assertions and then suggests political action. This is very much off-topic. A question seeking understanding of these budget situations or what various analysts or experts think about possible courses of action would be a little more relevant and much less controversial.</p>

<p>The fractional-reserve banking system question is... well, first, it's a notable bogeyman that various groups across the spectrum of politics like to drag out to cause panic.

Aside from that, it's a very leading question, and asks for a debate, not really answers. I'd close it.</p>

<li>The brokrage costs involved in such high volume trades  </li>

I'm further perplexed since I have no access to the question I asked; I've read about the <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/257/i-can-not-find-the-questions-i-asked-yesterday-on-this-website-whats-wrong"">visibility issue</a>, but I still get a blank screen after I log out and navigate through the ""Questions"" link (I believe this is what Jeff meant when he stated that one should ""navigate to the question URL directly).  Also, there are several other questions that are career based, but aren't closed.  These very questions are what I reviewed <em>prior</em> to posting to make sure that my question wouldn't fall into the cesspool of miffing inquiries.  I'm also quite dumbfounded when seeing that the ""career"" tag hasn't been relegated to oblivion.</p>

<p>So now my curiosity is piqued, but there's no way for me to really see my feedback, nor is there any way for me to edit &amp; trim my post so as to bring it in line.  Are there any other precedents I can review (as in another closed Career question) or is there any official material readily available concerning Career questions?</p>

<p>Also is there any way to work around the visibility issue?  Reset my modem, checked the question from another PC, but I still can't see it; I guess I should check from the library, coffee shop, or wherever else I can find internet access?  I know I can't participate in it any longer, but I just want to <em>see</em> the feedback for future improvement.

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>I've had a chance to take a look at the question from another location, while being logged in.  Kind of odd that it didn't work at my place, especially since I restarted every device in the network chain; anybody else have any similar experiences?</p>

<p>Now that I've been able to review the comments, I'm still curious as to how it's off-topic in comparison to the other career questions?  Not asking to be abrasively smarmy, just wanting to know where the distinction lies between ""Personal Finance"" &amp; one's ""Career"", since they're closely tied together (from my limited standpoint).  Regardless of the response I get to this meta question, I can acknowledge that my question has been ubiquitously deemed as off-topic, so I must ask: is there a domain in StackExchange where this could be appropriately migrated to?  I really do want to get some correlating responses...

<p>But there are added benefits to graduation.</p>
<h3>A Site Design</h3>
<p>The site gets its final design. The generic beta design is nice, but it is <em>generic</em>, by design. After graduation, new visitors will see a <em>form</em> that fits the <em>function</em> of the site.</p>

<p>Personal Finance will get a link at the bottom of every page in the Stack Exchange Network. The link in the footer is good for traffic. People often forget that this cross-pollination is so helpful to a site's growth.</p>

<p>A final stage stage to establishing your governance. Early on, we <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/118/moderator-pro-tem-announcement"">appointed several moderators</a> to engage the community in both the community-building issues and site management.

<h3>Network Lock-In</h3>
<p>Graduation tells the community (and everyone else) &quot;you finally made it.&quot; That's why we're waiting for that expected upturn in traffic site before launching the site. If all goes well, graduated sites also get some additional press/media/blog/article coverage from the notoriety surrounding a grand opening. That provides a nice source of traffic to the site.</p>

<p>It is difficult to tell whether a specific asset allocation is right for someone else.  That is typically the kind of thing you need to answer for yourself by learning about investing or by following the advice of a good financial adviser; which can obtain more detailed information about your specific situation.  Of course, that does not mean that people will not provide their opinions.  As long as they also provide their reasoning, it is useful information in my book.</p>

<p>A <strong>broker is a person (proper noun)</strong>, who must satisfy various legal requirements to achieve that status, including testing administered by his employer or the state. This is true in most or all countries. Some brokers are independent, some are affiliated with brokerage firms. The matter of an ""unlicensed broker"" is not a minor one, and sometimes a consideration for novice investors. (An unlicensed broker would be one whose license has been revoked, or lapsed.)</p>

<p>A <strong>brokerage firm</strong> is an organization. It too must satisfy a set of legal requirements to be designated as such. Brokerage firms charge fees. Brokers charge fees, sometimes called commissions. Thus I would consider <strong>brokerage as an adjective, not a noun</strong>. Please see the comment by @JoeTaxpayer on 23 May at 15:53. He is correct! It would be extremely misleading to colloquially refer to the <strong><em>fee associated with a brokerage</em></strong> as <strong><em>brokerage</em></strong>, which was stated as a possibility by @Dheer.</p>

  <p>all of the questions tagged as broker really mean brokerage by your definition</p>

Secondly, I possess an M.B.A. with a concentration in Finance from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, with ten years working experience in that industry. I would not mention this, as it seems like grandstanding.

<p>A question that asks, generically, ""<a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/6949/"">what do I do to prepare for apocalyptic disasters?</a>"" in my mind is automatically qualified as a question that is going to attract ambiguous answers based on the subjective determination of what the questioner is asking about.

<p>IMO, an in-scope ""doom"" question is one that is clearly talking about a specific scenario. The scenario needs to include details of both the disaster and the personal situation. To be a ""doom"" question that <strong>also yields good answers</strong>, it should also be associated with an illustrative, real-life scenario.</p>

<ul>
<li>How do I protect my wealth against a natural disaster that threatens to destroy my home? (Cite example of tornado strike that devastates a community)</li>
<li>I'm self-employed and run a small business/farm that caters to a local clientele. How can I prepare financially for a disaster that destroys my business and my customer's home/businesses? (Cite example of Mississippi floods, or Arizona/Texas wildfire)</li>
<li>I'm 53, partially disabled and have $650,000 in 401k accounts. In the event of a crash similar to what happened after Lehman Brothers collapsed, how can I protect my retirement savings while still earning a reasonable yield?</li>

A few questions here and there discussing how commodities like gold and silver relate to money and investment vehicles suitable for individuals are clearly appropriate. BitCoin questions should probably be treated similarly.</p>

<p>BitCoin is mildly controversial. (Heck, investment strategies using gold and silver and other commodities can be controversial too). StackExchange is not Wikipedia but a modicum of Wikipedia's ""neutral point of view"" technique is helpful here: document the controversy, but try not to feed the controversy. Discussion of the issues which people find controversial about BitCoin is appropriate; extensive debate about it really isn't.</p>

<p>In-depth questions on how to <strong>use</strong> BitCoin are probably completely off-topic. I generally approve of the BitCoin StackExchange proposal to create a more appropriate venue for these conversations. <strong>If and when</strong> this BitCoin stackexchange is created, it may be appropriate to move more BitCoin-related questions there as a matter of convenience, even questions which might otherwise be on topic here.</p>

That's not unusual but there's a few other sites that came out in the queue to graduate before Money.

<p><strong>What you can work on</strong> —</p>
<p><strong>4.6 questions per day</strong> is worrying. I think this site can do better. It's not the <em>quantity</em> of questions which is of concern. There is a concerning lack of <strong>intriguing questions</strong> and a <em>steady</em> group of top users to answer them. The way to combat that is to look for opportunities for high-quality content (like Joel just started on <a href=""https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/589/now-that-lion-is-out-help-promote-ask-different"">Apple SE</a>). Take a look at the blog post linked above, and to use those social bookmarks!</p>
<h2>It's time for a community Cleanup</h2>
<p><strong>This site can use a bit of a cleanup effort.</strong> There are a lot of questions which should never have passed community scrutiny. This community is much stronger now, so it's time to start a community-wide cleanup. If a question isn't worth answering (&quot;unanswerable&quot; as asked, or low quality), start ridding yourselves of that cruft. I'm estimating that the bottom ~10% of this site's questions are completely forgettable content that nobody would ever miss. Just delete it. That clean-up effort is best initiated and organized through a meta post. <em>Go for it.</em></p>

<p>Questions about tax-advantaged savings accounts, cd laddering, home mortgages, budgeting, etc. are independent of the macroeconomic climate. Our society has an overwhelming number of personal finance options and terminology that you need to have a good understanding of just to be a responsible adult. The rules regarding taxes alone are insanely complicated. Mortgage terms and fees are also complicated. But all of these rules and knowledge have practical value.</p>

<p>I just don't think this is working the way it is intended; given that the majority of the site audience appears to be in the US, there are many many questions asked that are US-specific but are not given the united-states tag. </p>

<p>For example, I just re-tagged <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/11561/can-my-so-deposit-a-check-made-out-to-me"">this question</a> with united-states. The wording of the question does not specify a location and there would be many different answers depending on the jurisdiction in question. It is evident from the OP's location that they intended the question to relate to the US, and indeed all the answers seem to apply to US-ian banking systems.</p>

<p>As a non-US-ian, this is probably more annoying to me than it is to the US-ian sections of the audience. I just think the idea of insisting on a regional tag (or ""other-region"" or ""international"") could usefully be reconsidered from this perspective.</p>

435,868,,2,,5,430,,,1,,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I may be somewhat biased as I provided a high scoring answer to a ""what to invest in if the world ends"" question.  However, I do agree that most of these questions have very little value.</p>

<p>That said, I think we should not rush to close and delete a question just because it asks about such a topic.  I think it should hinge on what practical value the question has.  One issue I readily see about this is that the practical value depends on the answers that the question garners.</p>

<p>For example, the question I am talking about brought out some important ideas:</p>

<p>1) Hedging against a total collapse of the system requires that we think about what would have value without the system.</p>

<p>2) There are practical limitations to what we can store, and protect, indefinitely.</p>

<p>3) It requires ""out of the box"" thinking, since we are basically talking about the destruction of the box.</p>

<p>Now, I do have some concerns about the hypothetical nature of such a question.  However, we can not completely avoid hypothetical situations in personal finance.  When we look into the future, it is all hypothetical until the future becomes the present.</p>

<p>Thus, I want to urge some caution so that we do not respond in a knee-jerk fashion to questions that can bring out important, practical ideas useful to planning our personal finances.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The question is asked in a limiting way, suggesting the person has already done a little searching themselves. E.G. ""I was in the bookstore looking for books that really teach technical analysis, ones that have exercises where the reader does their own analysis. I paged through 'Technical Analysis For Dummies' and 'Technical Analysis From A to Z' and neither have what I  want.  Are there any books out there that have what I'm looking for?""</p>

<p>By putting some scope on what's being sought, the questioner is doing a little bit to ensure the answers are going to be relevant to him.  Also, the answers are going to be something more than what one would get by doing [keyword] search on Amazon.</p></li>
<li><p>The answers contain enough detail that the person asking the question can make a judgement on whether they would be interested in the book. It's much more valuable to have answers that are clearly from someone who has read the book and thought about its strengths and weaknesses than to have ones where a title is being thrown out there with little to no other information.</p>

<p>If we can collectively maintain standard (2) then I don't think the questions would become useless space-fillers. Otherwise, we would have to fall back on (1), such that when someone asks a question like ""What are some good books on investing"", we inquire in a comment ""Is there anything in particular we can help you with?""  and explain that we discourage wide-open questions.</p></li>

  <p>At electronics.SE we allow homework questions as long as it is still

  essentially, remove any references to it being a homework question,
  and if it is still a good question then it can stand. The problem with
  this question is an answer could simply be ""Yes"" and nothing else. It
  is good to see effort on the part of the OP, but it also has to have
  room for a good answer. – Kellenjb</p>

I say that as someone who is attracted to the StackExchange platform on other sites <em>because</em> of the LaTeX support.</p>

<p>The main reason I wouldn't support this is that on Money SE, I think people would more often than not <em>inadvertantly</em> go into math mode as soon as they typed a <code>$</code>.  Then they'd just be confused about why all of their text is italicized and all the spacing is messed up.

Yes, there are lots of metrics that one can use to ""measure"" a site, but we don't really care about those as much as we care about a site providing expert answers to good questions.

<p>This process is currently still in the midst of being put together, but you all are going to be a lucky early-adopter! Here's a rough guide: </p>

<ul>
<li>Below, you'll find ten questions randomly selected from your site.</li>
<li>For each question, search the internet for the question as if you were the asker!</li>
<li>If our answer is good (complete, well-written, answers the question, found in search results, etc) then <strong>vote it up</strong>!</li>
<li>If our answer is bad (incomplete, poorly-written, off-topic, unfindable, etc) then <strong>vote it down</strong>!</li>
</ul>

<p>Comment with anything you feel is worth noting, or to explain your voting choice. We have a rough guide to better/par/worse <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/EQxi7.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">right here</a>. If your result is par, make a choice to vote up or down based on your instincts! </p>

<p>Ultimately, remember that our goal is to make the internet a better place. If you find yourself torn between the options, or if you can't decide, ask yourself: does this question and/or answer make the internet better? That should help you decide. </p>

There's <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/130342/salvage-questions-on-closed-sites-via-migration"">a movement building up</a> (<a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/130347"">approved by the SE staff</a>) to migrate as much of the content from these sites as possible to other, more active SE sites.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that some of the questions on Economics.SE might be on topic here, so I thought I'd ask for your opinions and help with getting these questions salvaged.  If you feel that this would be a good idea, here's what you can do:</p>

<ul>
<li>Express your support for migrating these questions here, so that the SE folks can tell that the community here is (as I hope, at least) in favor of it.</li>
<li>Go through the list of <a href=""https://economics.stackexchange.com/questions"">questions on Economics.SE</a> and look for ones that would be on topic here.</li>
<li>Collect links to the questions here, so that we can point an Economics mod at them before the site closes (<a href=""https://scifi.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1746/literature-is-closing-what-questions-should-we-migrate-here"">example of such a list at SF&amp;F meta</a>).  Or you could just flag the questions for migration directly, but this way we avoid needless duplicate flags.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that <em>we only have about a week to do this</em> before the site will be closed.  The SE folks have said that they may be willing to extend the deadline to let active migration finish, but that applies only if the process has at least been started well before the deadline.</p>

<p>Ps. I've also posted about this on the <a href=""https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/4049/economics-se-is-closing-can-we-salvage-some-of-the-questions"">Math.SE</a>, <a href=""https://stats.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1117/economics-se-is-closing-can-we-salvage-some-of-the-questions"">Stats.SE</a> and <a href=""https://quant.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/291/economics-se-is-closing-do-we-want-some-of-their-questions"">Quant.SE</a> metas, as the scope of all these sites overlaps at least somewhat with Economics.SE.  There's also a <a href=""https://economics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/165/salvaging-questions-by-migration"">central post on the Econ.SE meta</a> listing potential migration targets.</p>

<p>(Personal disclaimer: I've never been active on either Economics.SE or here; indeed, I only found out about these sites recently.  I just feel I should at least try to do something to help keep these questions alive and on the web, rather than just gathering digital dust in a compressed archive somewhere.)</p>

<p>The site seems to be having a lot of questions closed recently - although that may be simply my perception and not borne out by the facts.</p>

<p>The direct follow-up to the first issue would be: Are we having too many questions posted that get closed? (Obviously this is a very different sort of question.)</p>

496,3,-1,2,,2,495,,,2,,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I think the rate would vary widely from site to site, based on factors such as the site's on- and off-topic policies, popularity of the site topic, discoverability of the site (e.g. popular in Google? then expect more questions posted by new users who didn't first read the FAQ), as well as how aggressive moderators and community members are at closing questions.</p>

<p>Anyway &ndash; this is not complete or scientific, but for what it's worth:  See the <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/search?tab=newest&amp;q=closed:1"">list of closed questions on Money</a>, i.e. closed (but <em>not</em> deleted) questions on the site right now, in reverse chronological order.  If you count the number closed just in April, there are 9.  Then, look at the <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions?sort=newest"">list of all questions on Money</a>, also reverse order. I count 145 in April alone (almost 3 pages at 50 per page).  So, 9 / 145 =~ <strong>6.2%</strong> closed in April, and that's assuming none of the April-closed questions have been deleted yet (I haven't been on a mass-deletion spree in a little while.)</p>

<p>To compare, head over to Super User and look at <a href=""https://superuser.com/search?tab=newest&amp;q=closed:1"">this</a> and <a href=""https://superuser.com/questions?sort=newest"">this</a>, which are similar lists to those above but for Super User. I get counts of 479 closed in April vs. 4355 total questions in April (and again, this excludes <em>deleted</em> questions .. which I can't see on Superuser anyway.)  So, 479/4355 =~ <strong>11%</strong>.</p>

<p>Based on just that one site I picked, I don't think we're closing questions too frequently.  <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/a/494/3"">Some people think</a> we're not closing often enough.</p>

<p>I'd love to see some network-wide statistics on this, though, so I'm hoping a Stack Exchange community co-ordinator / super-moderator can add to this discussion?  I did find <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/33757/percentage-of-closed-questions"">this question</a> at the network-wide meta, but the information is stale and just for Stack Overflow itself.</p>

<p>Finally .. is there any one particular recent closure that concerns you?  I think in the aggregate there is probably not a problem, but if you think there was something closed recently that shouldn't have been, you can shine a light on it here at meta and we can all discuss.</p>

<blockquote>

  <li>we are being asked an open-ended, hypothetical question: “What if ______ happened?”</li>

<p>... i.e. the question under discussion could lead to <strong>open-ended speculation</strong>.  Who here can know what will or won't happen to U.K. banks with the situation in Europe potentially worsening?  We value questions that have answers, not leading to prognostication.  Is there an answer to this question?</p>

<p>If the question says will my ability to withdraw funds be limited in case of Bank run? Or Is there is Govt safety net [some Federal guarantee that my money is safe]? etc would be more relevant personal finance question.</p>

<p>The impact of Euro Zone crisis is not fully understood even by leading economists and to speculate on the implications for others is something not directly related to personal finance.</p>

<p>If we consider this on topic, then there could be similar cause and effect questions that are too broad; For example if there is Great Depression, and jobs are being lost, will it impact the Job market in ""Paradise"" country, or will the Govt take my money kept in Banks as Taxes.</p>

508,5226,,2,,4,505,,,3,,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I think it would have been better to have encouraged me to rephrase the question to a more 'acceptable' format.</p>

<p>This is a problem I'm increasingly seeing across SE sites, where more advanced members close questions from new members on the basis of not liking the format of the question, rather than the premise. It would be much more helpful - and in the long-term interests of the growth and sustainability of the SE community - if new members were given help and encouragement to participate in accordance with the sometimes esoteric requirements of SE communities. I've seen this happen on occasion and the outcome is much better for all - the new user learns, the question is improved and the SE body of knowledge continues to grow. By just closing a question - often with a snarky comment or two - nobody is helped.</p>

<p>Yes, I read the FAQ and having done that, I took the decision that my question was still relevant. I'm a bank account holder in the UK and I'm concerned about the prospect of bank runs in the eurozone affecting such a thing in the UK. For a country so closely tied in with eurozone countries, it doesn't seem unreasonable to hold the notion that we could suffer. As an individual without much of an understanding of finance and banking, I wanted to know how this would affect my personal finances.</p>

<p>Of course, the question doesn't have an absolute answer, but then there are plenty of questions out there that also don't have an absolute answer. I can see ""what is the best...""-type questions today and they're open and being contributed to. But my question had a degree of relative scope to it. If someone had knowledge to suggest that the question had been credibly discussed elsewhere and found that there was/ wasn't a danger to individuals' personal finances in the UK, then that surely would have been an answer to provide?</p>

<p>Let's say the question title was: <strong><em>""How would you invest your money to be safe in the hypotethical event of bank run in UK due to Euro crisis?""</em></strong></p>

<p>Well this is a question that has got a huge to do with personal finance and personal money.</p>

<p>The only answer is probably: ""nobody knows what will happen, but if you want to sleep well for the next couple of years, buy physical gold (even if it's not convenient) and buy soverign bonds from Australia and Canada or any other states with a low Debt/GDP ratio and low budget/GDP ratio (beside the fact that <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/15137/governments-debt-gdp-and-budget-deficit-surplus-how-to-read-the-figures-to-de"">someone says it's off topic also to talk about Debt/GDP ratios</a> like if it's a subject that could be discussed only by Einstein and Newton or some other genius).</p>

<p>I do respect the effort of moderators to try not to transofrm this site in a speculative site talking only about EURO doom theories, but in this period of time when <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/a/15226/2120"">Paul Krugman, CITI, Morgan Stanely, clearly states that EURO is coming to an end</a>, I'm wondering how much can be considered simple speculation talking about euro crisis even in terms of possible bank run.</p>

Part of this is because it does seem like a lot of posts get closed for being duplicates and I'm afraid of being admonished because my question has been covered elsewhere, even if it is specific to my situation.  For example, if I was to ask a question about what is better - paying down my high-rate consumer credit card or paying down my lower-rate school loan - would it be closed because others have asked a similar question?</p>

<p>My personal POV for a possible solution is to simply accept each other cult and allow both.</p>

<p>In this community there could be people more interested in economy and other more interested in day by day money chores. I don't see how one subject could badly affect the other, as long as there are users willing to answer both type of questions, and it seems there are!!!</p>

<p>Talking about both Economy and Money chores simply expands a bit the interests in this community.</p>

  <p>If you have a question about:</p>

<pre><code>Personal investing and asset allocation
The financial aspects of home buying
Best practices for saving for retirement, education, and other goals
Strategies for creating and sticking to a budget
Strategies for earning and saving more money
**Specific macro or micro economic issues that have a direct impact on day to day investments for the retail investor.**
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>I think the question about where money comes from is one of those fundamental issues that once understood on a broad level, makes a personal investor a little bit more savvy.  How money is created will let an investor make better evaluations of the markets and the politics surrounding the markets.  If investing is really just educated guesses, then I feel that sort of education is important.</p>

<p>Perhaps the clothing question could be rewritten to explain the trade offs and opportunities costs that will allow an investor to quit doing a silly thing with a sunk cost and manage money with great goals and possible rewards.</p>

<p>The reason I can see to NOT edit the definition to include basic macro economic literacy, is that stack exchange isn't supposed to be a resource for basic information.  Can we edit the site definition to explain what we think users should already know before posting a question here?</p>

The major points of capitalism on a macro level
What a credit score is

That question would be closed since something labeled as a nail shall be recognized as a nail and the quality of the nail is irrelevant.  Nails could be made of little cotton pieces of paper with pictures of dead oppressors but that does not matter - they are still nails.  This site fails to recognize that the QUALITY of money is just as important as how to invest, save, or spend said money.  In that regard, it is very important to know the composition of the money you use as well as how new money is created.</p>

<p>In regards to DIY versus purchasing an item: I do not have a strong opinion on this one.  These questions would be beneficial if an answered appeared where someone actually attempted the DIY and summarized their methods, tools, and cost.  I think it is going to be hard to get those answers on a finance website.</p>

<p>I essentially use one question to determine if a question is appropriate for this site:  </p>

<p>""Will the question and corresponding answer cause me to change how I invest, save, or spend my money?""</p>

<p>Money composition and creation questions are relevant to what I do with my money.</p>

<p>Anything related to economy is relevant to your personal finance.</p>

<p>Take a look at gold standard. If government use gold as money then everyone will just buy and hold gold and no body will invest anything. That's because the amount of gold is constant while our economy is expanding.</p>

<p>However, further study shows that it's what people do anyway whether government use gold standard or not. Also people horde land, etc.</p>

<p>In fact, I do not quite understand whether having gold standard will do any good or bad to economy. It'll be just a different standard. Obviously my libertarian friends do not like government arbitrarily manipulating interest rate. But if government do, can we ride the wave?</p>

<p>So understanding something simple as gold standard or bitcoins is very important for your personal finance decision.</p>

556,3,-1,2,,4,555,,,15,,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I don't think it was dismissed (and closed) because the answer was included in one of the sources the OP mentioned outright.  Demonstrating one has done some of the research already is actually a Good Thing.</p>

<p>Rather, we prefer the site not be used to ask questions about individual, specifically-named stocks where the end goal may be to buy or sell the stock.  Many individual-company stock boards or forums exist precisely for that purpose.  For example, <a href=""http://boards.fool.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> and <a href=""http://stockhouse.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> and <a href=""http://investorvillage.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.  (Quality varies; and notice I didn't mention the one that starts with ""Y"" and ends with ""!"")</p>

<p>If the question were generalized to not be specific to Microsoft, and using Microsoft merely as an <em>example</em> to support the more general question, then it may have survived.  e.g. Q: <strong>""How do I find out how an integrated technology company makes money?""</strong>  (A: Read the annual report, and here are some things you should know about companies in the industry... etc. etc.) .. or something along those lines, I hope you get the idea.</p>

<p>Consider the alternative if we <em>did</em> allow questions of the form.  Then all of these are valid questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>How does Apple make money?</li>
<li>How does Google make money?</li>
<li>How does Oracle make money?</li>
<li>How does Yahoo! make money?</li>
<li>How does Facebook make money?</li>
<li>How does Hewlett-Packard make money?</li>
<li>... etc <strong>times thousands of stock symbols</strong> ...  (similar to the issue discussed <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/512/discuss-sam-brand-blog-post-on-blog-stackoverflow-regarding-hot-topics"">here</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>And consequent to us allowing <em>those</em> kinds of questions would be the degeneration of the signal-to-noise ratio, and a consequent influx of people posting poor-quality questions or answers simply to shill/promote/pump &amp; dump a particular stock, or to find validation or consensus for some investment decision they made.

<p>We have already established that basic questions of economics will generally be on topic.  The FAQ states that the following type of question is off-topic:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Academic questions about economics or questions about economics that have no bearing on personal finance</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We cannot avoid the fact that some topics of economics have a bearing on personal finance. The difficulty is in making that determination.</p>

<p>That question is basically asking for a definition of an economics principle.  Asking questions about such topics, in order to understand them, should certainly be on topic for this site when it's a topic you hear about in the news.  It's not just an academic discussion and money creation does have a bearing on personal finance.</p>

<p>The site is named Personal Finance and <em>Money</em>, because it should be a touch broader than simply <em>personal</em> finance.  It's certainly not supposed to be about economics, but there are many economics topics which are of interest to someone thinking about their personal finances.  Obtaining a general understanding of how a central bank creates money and knowing if/how it has an impact on one's personal finances, should be a valid goal for a user of this site.</p>

<p>In my <em>personal</em> opinion, it doesn't matter if it actually applies to personal finance.  Individuals in the process of thinking about their personal finances, in one way or another, will likely wonder about such a topic; if only because they heard talking heads flapping gums about it in the business news.  </p>

578,414,3,1,,12,,323,7,3,,,WOOHOO! Seven Hundred Days in Beta!,<discussion>,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>This is getting to be a bit of a dubious distinction.</p>

<p>A quick observation as we cross this milestone:</p>

<p>Hordes of qualified people aren't going to be flocking to this site to answer questions, especially the people interested in the topic:  personal finance bloggers.  The few who are on here (myself, JoeTaxpayer, littleadv, and a handful of others) are the exception.  The average personal finance blogger is more entrepreneurial than the average programmer.  They (PF bloggers) will see not only little opportunity to promote their own work here, but also a group hostile to said promotion, and either go where they can leave their website URL as many times as they want, or just build their own blog, attract their own traffic, make their own money.  What works astoundingly well for programmers works very poorly for personal finance guys/gals; we (as a whole) know exactly what <a href=""http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/08/are-you-a-digital-sharecropper.html"" rel=""nofollow"">digital sharecropping</a> is, and know to avoid it.</p>

<p>I participate because I like helping people.  But I've always enjoyed benefiting financially from what I write about, and considering I'm the fourth-highest ranked user on the main site, and have less than 300 profile views, <em>total</em>, the reward (to the rest of my online presence) is miniscule compared to the time I spend here.</p>

<p>CFPs and the like probably won't come here in droves, either.  Too many legal restrictions on what they can say, and they're probably going to want to use the site to bring in more business, which is all but verboten here.</p>

<p>So, that's my take as to why we're still in beta, why the number of questions per day still ""needs work"" and why the site's visits per day is stagnant.</p>

585,,,2,,9,578,,,3,user296,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>Here's my take: There are two kinds of people I've seen around here, people who ask questions and people who answer them. I mean, there's some overlap, but there's a lot less overlap than on StackOverflow. Also, that's an observation, at present, not a value judgement. Programming is a field that's very broad; there are a lot of people who are an expert in one area but exposed to some intricate little detail of another area where things are very finicky. Our questions are usually a little broader than ""what have I misconfigured and how do I find out why isn't my site-to-site ipsec VPN tunnel attempting to do NAT traversal?"". Most people who are experienced are also more capable of self-service. Most people who are not particularly experienced probably won't stick around to answer more questions, for lack of expertise or perceived expertise. And most personal-finance questions only come up occasionally - when dealing with a new loan, credit card, or other complicated transaction - whereas a programmer may be exposed to new things much more frequently under the right conditions.</p>

<p>With that observation in hand, I'd like to ask whether or not our question is a lack of ""personal finance blogger"" personalities, as opposed to a lack of J Random Citizen participation. Have there been a lot of people asking questions which could have been easily answered but weren't, or which lingered for days and weeks on end? Are the personalities who do exist being too self-promotional and linking to their personal sites all the time to get referrals? My casual observations say otherwise. If that's the case, I don't think that we should worry about personal-finance-blogger-type personalities coming here as much as we should worry about getting a large quantity of what the SEO types would call ""organic traffic"" to land here - new users, and lots of them, even if our retention appears weak in relative terms.</p>

<p>Also - I'm not a personal-finance blogger, I'm just a dude who grew up with a Ph.D. economist in the house who realizes a personal benefit from doing helpful things for random people like that. I could set up a blog, and try to attract followers and make money, but the opportunity cost of the time and effort to do so is too high for me to bother. ;)</p>

<p>The comments are <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/14055/is-it-even-possible-to-refinance-an-older-car#comment21685_14055"">here</a>, by DJClayworth. They seem to be born out of a general anti-credit view that pervades questions about loans -- the general assumption on the site is that everyone has savings and is capable of saving up a few grand for a car with no trouble, thus avoiding loans altogether (see, for example, <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/15553/how-to-get-car-loan-with-no-credit?rq=1"">these answers</a>, which basically boil down to ""don't get a loan"", or the top answer <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/8/im-thinking-of-getting-a-new-car-why-shouldnt-i-lease-one?rq=1"">here</a>, which outright states ""If you cannot buy a car outright with cash, you cannot afford it. Period.""). For someone like me, who is underpaid and struggling with medical expenses, the whole ""never ever take a loan"" attitude seems unhelpful and harsh. Openly rebuking me for past mistakes just adds icing on the cake. </p>

<p>And because I feel like I have to defend myself: Without a car, I could have no income at all. By the time I managed to find a job, my savings were gone and I'd already borrowed money from relatives to try and make ends meet. I was lied to by the dealership (they quoted me a significantly smaller APR than was on the paperwork I signed then backed me into a corner about signing it) and didn't anticipate my medical bills being so high (since I didn't have insurance at all yet, I was not getting treatment for my problem; my insurance has the highest copay any of my doctors have ever seen, but what else can I do, not get better?). This job is awful in terms of compensation, but it's on contract so in a few months I'll be able to get a better one, and at least I have food on the table. My situation is not uncommon in these current troubling times, but it seems like a lot of answers assume much better economic conditions. </p>

<p>I recently tried to format a financial formula using the Tex markup that I've seen used on some of the other math/science oriented stackexchange sites, but it didn't seem to work as I expected. To be fair, I've never used Tex markup before on any site, so I may have just been doing it wrong.</p>

<p>Is Tex markup something that is enabled on a site by site basis, and if so should it be enabled on this one?</p>

<p>I know most people on this site probably wouldn't use it but there are enough formulae that relate to personal finance that it seems like it would be nice to have for those of us who want to use it.</p>

While economics is not all that related to <em>personal</em> finance, consumer issues are very tightly so, and I think your proposal makes sense. But I'm biased, consumer issues are the main theme of my blog:)</p>

601,2998,,2,,2,578,,,0,,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>Thanks for bringing the issue up. I'm actually flattered that you've mentioned me, but it is something to point out: until recently I had no formal education or qualification in personal finances of any kind (until recently because I decided to take and pass SEE this summer). A regular RT/E C programmer for you here, who got swayed into money@SE from the main site (at some point I was even making effort to raise my rep on the main site not to let money@SE rep pass it, but gave up in the end...). Yes, I do have a blog, but it is not for profit, and probably that's why I don't mind not being able to ""promote"" it anywhere.</p>

<p>My point is: there are many people who can get interested in joining the community, in the places least expected. We just need to make sure that people can actually participate, and that means - widen the range of accepted topics. I would definitely consider consumer issues, taxes, ans similar to be things directly related to ""personal finances and money"". </p>

<p>What I would not want is to see the site being filled with macro-economics, technical stock analysis, bit-coins and conspiracies, and similar topics that have no relation to the daily life of a normal person. That limitation might turn off some of my fellow RT/E C programmers, I know.</p>

<p>One of the most important aspects of being a Stack Exchange site is quality. Yes, there are lots of metrics that one can use to ""measure"" a site, but we don't really care about those as much as we care about a site providing expert answers to good questions. To that end, we're introducing a self-evaluation to our sites!</p>

<p>This process is currently still in the midst of being put together, but you all are going to be a lucky early-adopter! Here's a rough guide:</p>

<pre><code>Below, you'll find ten questions randomly selected from your site.
For each question, search the internet for the question as if you were the asker!
If our answer is good (complete, well-written, answers the question, found in search results, etc) then vote it up!
If our answer is bad (incomplete, poorly-written, off-topic, unfindable, etc) then vote it down!
</code></pre>

<p>Comment with anything you feel is worth noting, or to explain your voting choice. We have a rough guide to better/par/worse right here. If your result is par, make a choice to vote up or down based on your instincts!</p>

<p>Ultimately, remember that our goal is to make the internet a better place. If you find yourself torn between the options, or if you can't decide, ask yourself: does this question and/or answer make the internet better? That should help you decide.</p>

<p>This eval will close on September 7th or something...</p>

<p>These questions all go out of date quickly.  Online brokers go out of business, change names, and go from being free to paid services.  Tax Prep software quality can change drastically over time.  I don't think we're making the internet a better place by having these out of date questions lying around all over the place, and SE doesn't provide a good mechanism for having the top answers updated routinely.  </p>

It's like studying hard for an exam and writing the paper, but not knowing how the answers are evaluated or what the passing marks are :)</p>

<p>First, the statistics for all the sites can be viewed <a href=""http://stackexchange.com/sites?view=list#traffic"">here</a>.  Next, if we look at current graduated sites compared to Money SE:</p>

<li><p>The ""Questions per Day"" is <em>less</em> than Money SE's for the following sites: Role-playing Games, Bicycles, Seasoned Advice, </p></li>

<p>I've been concerned about the lack of specificity for some years now.  Stack Inc.'s policy appears to be <em>""we'll know it when we see it, and not before then""</em>.  These metrics we are given are to keep us busy working on <em>some</em> of the things that are important, but not to actually set the bar, because the ""other stuff"" they're looking for is nebulous and subjective.  Frustrates me.</p>

<p>Personally, I don't see the <em>harm</em> in graduating our site <strong>now</strong>, given metrics like those above, and it would make oh-so-many of us happy to finally pass and get a real <strong>site branding/design treatment</strong> ... that would help make it a <em>home</em>, instead of these temporary-looking ""beta"" living quarters.</p>

<p>To me, the fact that Dheer is considering some mechanism to attempt to keep them up-to-date hints at this same issue.  </p>

<p>That is, we expect that acceptable, but problematic, questions/answers will be refined by the community.  This can happen when the question is first asked (or the answer is first given).  This also happens after-the-fact, when someone comes across a question/answer that requires correction.</p>

<p>However, that paradigm doesn't work well for things that need regular attention and, to me, it goes against the very philosophy of these sites.  While SEI keeps a tight grip on the reigns, the sites work in mainly decentralized fashion.</p>

<p>For example, moderators on these sites are tasked with being exception handlers.  That is, we are here to handle situations that can't be handled by the provided (decentralized) mechanisms.</p>

<p>We can certainly imagine mechanismd for tracking these questions. However, settings things up so that we accept questions which we know <strong>must</strong> be updated regularly goes against the nature of these sites.</p>

<p>You're struggling against a broken metaphor I've been trying to get repealed for a year now. Graduation isn't like high school where four years or 44 credits means picking up your diploma at the door. That's the entire point behind</p>
<p><a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/07/does-this-site-have-a-chance-of-succeeding/""><strong>Does this site have a chance of succeeding?</strong></a></p>
<p>&quot;Graduation&quot; is a horrible misnomer that <em>suggests</em> that if you are <em>not</em> graduating, you're somehow being held back while the bigger kids go on to <em>real world.</em> That is not the case, and you're getting all worked up over labels which mean very little in this context.</p>
<h1>The Meaning of Graduation</h1>
<p>Every once in awhile, a site takes off like a shot with inexorable growth that virtually guarantees the future success of a site that comes with long sustained growth.</p>
<p><em><strong>The Earmarks of a Graduated Site</strong></em>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/K8k0f.png"" alt=""The Earmarks of a Graduated Site"" /></p>
<p>In our nomenclature, that when <em>graduation</em> occurs.</p>
<p>A more accurate term might be something like <strong>&quot;tenure&quot;</strong> — the permanent post you achieve when you've reached a point of self-sufficiency and inevitable lock-in. Similarly, some sites achieve sustainable growth that all but guarantees you can keep it all going for the foreseeable future. That's the major difference between <em>graduation</em> (sic) and beta.</p>
<h1>So Why Not Just Graduate Us?</h1>
<p><strong>You're trying to force some sort of binary decision on us</strong>, that we should right now either guarantee the future health and growth of this site, or shut it down in failure.</p>
<p>You tell me.</p>
<p><em><strong>The Growth of Money SE</strong></em>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jkTyY.png"" alt=""The Growth of Money SE"" /></p>
<p>In terms of lock-in and long, sustained growth, you're not there yet. You can make light of our lack of specificity when that will happen, or act like we're just pulling some sort of charade just to shroud the process in secrecy, but I don't know any other way to say it beyond <em>'you simply are not there yet.'</em></p>
<h1>So why are we in beta?</h1>
<p>Personally, I'd rather call this phase of your growth — <em>(drum roll)</em> — <em>nothing.</em> Traditionally, the <em>beta</em> label was used to give notice that a product or service was in the <em>wild west</em> days of development… a time when things are subject to wild changes when you're still establishing what a site is about. Ideally, a beta label should be removed after a few months, once you assert your identity and scope.</p>
<p>Stop thinking of yourselves like you're some sort of helpless underling. You are a fully-featured, fully-functional Stack Exchange site helping people get answers to their questions with a 98% success rate. That's quite an achievement.</p>
<p>On a more resolute note, we <em>are</em> working out <a href=""https://area51.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5089/next-generation-of-area-51/5102#5102"">a new workflow to create and grow Stack Exchange sites</a>. The changes being proposed will one day apply equally to both proposed and active site. So maybe my disagreement about the labeling issues carries over to another day. Who knows.</p>
<p>But stop worrying about graduation. You got a new design only six months ago that was designed to let you carry on without looking like some sort of half-baked start-up.</p>

<p>Not to minimize your concerns, but I'm with you on the whole labeling thing. But also consider the reality that you're building up a canon of knowledge where 2,500 people visit every days and have about a 98% chance that they'll get a good answer to their question. The horrors.</p>

642,414,-1,2,,1,637,,,1,,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>MrChrister, my apologies for being tardy in responding, especially since you addressed me directly in your comments.  Thanks for bringing this up.</p>

<p>More love for bloggers who are discussed / active on this site?  I'd be silly to argue against that, wouldn't I?  :)</p>

<p>If anyone wants to summarize, and link to, something on my blog, I'd be insane to argue against that as well.</p>

<p>Regarding the larger issue, which is the level of link-back and promotion options to people using this site to external sites that serve their own interests, doing things like those proposed in the question would receive <em>strong</em> push-back were they to be suggested on the main programming site.  (Look at <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/147745/limits-for-self-promotion-round-iii/147752#147752"">the carnage that ensued</a> when I stuck up for people who were answering questions -- well -- that promoted their own products, with full disclosure.)</p>

<p>It's just a very different mode of operation on the programming site.  My paraphrase: ""If you have a product, let someone else answer with how good it is, but don't toot your own horn.""  And, from the <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/faq#promotion"">FAQ</a>: ""If a huge percentage of your posts include a mention of your product or website, you're probably here for the wrong reasons.""</p>

<p>This creates a virtuous circle both for the selfless, active members, and for Stack Exchange, Inc.  The active members have the majority, and the owners, on their side when it comes to even helpfully-presented self-promotion (i.e., it doesn't belong here) and the owners get traffic to a huge and nearly spam-free body of content -- which, by the way, they <em>sell ads on</em>, but that isn't talked about very much. :)</p>

<p>So, I would dearly <em>love</em> to answer questions in a way that I can summarize one of my posts, and link to it.  However, that would get me on the dirt list of influential people here, and probably a fair number of the members.  That, and <em>even when</em> people follow the rules of full disclosure, there are still the Office Space restaurant owners that say you're not wearing enough flair.  ""But it's a helpful answer, and I'm disclosing my relationship with the company.""  ""We don't care, you need to do it less.""  It's tiring to see it again and again, and I'm not one to roll up my sleeves and duke it out when it comes to my own content.</p>

<p>The bottom line is this:  Everyone's time is valuable and irreplaceable, and everyone gets to choose how they spend it, especially their discretionary time.  I enjoy answering questions on the different SE sites.  I also get benefit from asking them.</p>

<p>When it comes to personal finance, though, my blog is an additional source of income, and all of my online actions either contribute to that source of income, or they don't.  It sounds selfish, and I may be short-sheeting participation here, but it's a very long, slogging route for me to see return benefit the way things are now for the content I post here.  <strong>Joe Taxpayer has had less than one profile view per question he's answered.  Same with me.  Yet that is <em>exactly</em> the route that the SE community at large wants self-promotion to happen.</strong></p>

<p>I can post a <em>comment</em> on another blogger's post and link to my website!  The link might even be a <code>dofollow</code> link!</p>

<p>That's why I'm a little bit torn each time I answer a question here -- <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/a/17029/414"">like I just did</a> -- and advocate that people start a side business.  What am I doing right now to move <em>my</em> business forward?  I've already typed a longer-than-average post here, for the possibility of a fraction of one visit to my site, statistically.</p>

<p><a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/q/578/414"">As I've mentioned before</a>, most PF bloggers already get this.  I was an owner of a Stack Exchange 1.0 site, and I couldn't get participation from but a handful of bloggers.  They all have their own empires to build.</p>

<p><strong>Having said all of that, though :)</strong> -- if there's a discussion about one of my posts here, if I don't catch it, just let me know, and I'll link back to it.</p>

643,3127,-1,1,,12,,274,0,8,,,The future of Personal Finance and Money,<discussion><site-promotion>,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>As one of our longest-lived &quot;beta&quot; sites, there've been quite a few concerns raised here over the years as to the future of Personal Finance and Money. And understandably so. We've tried several times to provide feedback, but looking over the recent discussions here on Meta I can't help but feel that it hasn't really helped much. So I'd like to state, for the record, where we at SE, Inc. see Money.SE now, and where we see it headed.</p>
<h2>The purpose of having three &quot;stages&quot; for a site</h2>
<p>Remember SE 1.0? Some of you <em>should</em> - this site has its beginnings there. A lot of sites did. Unfortunately, they also had their endings there as well. It was our experience with SE 1.0 that taught us the importance of putting together a strong, cohesive community before pushing a site forward. The three stages - private beta, public beta, graduated - were intended to represent a clear progression from concept to fully-functioning Q&amp;A site. And for the most part, this has worked...</p>
<p>In this case, it has clearly <em>not</em> worked. Money.SE isn't <em>failing</em> - there's a healthy core community at work here, questions are getting answered and I have no worries that the site <em>could</em> continue operating indefinitely. However, it hasn't yet met our internal criteria for &quot;graduation&quot;.</p>
<h2>What does graduation mean?</h2>
<p>Externally, &quot;graduation&quot; seems pretty straight-forward: you get more inbound links, a custom design for the site, moderator elections, a change to the reputation requirements for various moderation activities, and a few extra internal/external promotional tools.</p>
<p>Internally, it's a pretty big deal: we take a lot of pride in the sites we graduate, and the time and resources we devote to them - from the work put into creating a top-class design to the time and money put into promotional efforts - follow from this. As a small (<a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/10/join-the-stack-exchange-team-were-hiring/"">but growing</a>!) company, we have to be very careful to ensure that we direct our efforts in the areas where they'll do the <em>most</em> good.</p>
<p>As has been mentioned before, we look at quite a few different things before electing to &quot;graduate&quot; a site. Some of the most important include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quality</li>
<li>Growth</li>
<li>Size of the core community</li>
</ul>
<p>By your own admission, the quality here is <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/622/personal-finance-and-money-self-evaluation-lets-get-critical"">pretty good</a>. As Robert noted a few days back, <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/635/finally-the-area51-scorecard-is-only-one-metric-we-use-to-determine-graduatio"">growth</a> is lacking, but you're not <em>shrinking</em> so that's something at least. The size of the core is harder to judge - you can look around you and see the participation on Meta, which is usually a pretty solid indicator of an engaged core; there are two other factors I like to look at:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to hold elections</li>
<li>Ability to sustain self-moderation with higher reputation thresholds</li>
</ul>
<p>Guess what? You're pretty solid here too. This is - except for the relatively-flat growth patterns - a fully-operational Q&amp;A site.</p>
<h2>So why not graduate?</h2>
<p>Two out of three ain't half-bad, right? So who cares about growth, why not just launch this baby?</p>
<p>Well... It turns out that growth factor is pretty important. No matter how much SE, Inc. likes a site, there's not much <em>we</em> can do to make it grow - promotional efforts are, at best, the equivalent of a bit of extra fertilizer on an already-healthy plant - if it's not growing, dumping more on won't speed it up. The bulk of a site's traffic - and audience, and eventually membership and core of expertise - comes in from search engine traffic: folks looking for questions and answers on a topic. We put a lot of work into (honest) SEO for every site, but the ability of folks to find what they're looking for and stick around owes most of its success to <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/622/personal-finance-and-money-self-evaluation-lets-get-critical"">the quality of the content itself</a>. When that's not already happening naturally, experience has taught us there's not a whole lot we can do in most cases to <em>make</em> it happen.</p>
<h2>Will this site <em>ever</em> graduate?</h2>
<p>Personal finance is a tough topic to really stand out in. There are <em>many</em> world-class experts and writers already churning out good information elsewhere. The fact that y'all are doing as well as you are is a testament to your dedication and skill. I respect that; but it doesn't change anything: we have other, similarly difficult topics, and while we're more and more willing (and able) to support keeping them around as long as they're <em>working</em>, they're never going to justify the sort of resources that a larger, faster-growing site will.</p>
<p>Personally, I think this site <em>does</em> have what it takes - but it hasn't been an easy or quick road thus far, and there's precious little I can do to make it any easier. If you're writing about personal finance - here or anywhere else - you've got your work cut out for you.</p>
<p>Frankly, you shouldn't worry about it. If you're here, it should be because you enjoy helping other people, disseminating good information and correcting misinformation. Nothing that comes with site graduation - or before it, or after it - should greatly affect your ability to do that here.</p>
<h2>So... what then? Nothing?</h2>
<p>This is the point that Robert was trying to get across in his answer <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/635/finally-the-area51-scorecard-is-only-one-metric-we-use-to-determine-graduatio"">here</a>: for a site like this one, that &quot;beta&quot; tag means fairly little. You know who you are, you know what you're about, and you know what you're doing here. The site works. It needs momentum, but that's not being helped by labels and hand-wavy feedback: you're already keenly aware of <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/622/personal-finance-and-money-self-evaluation-lets-get-critical"">how you're doing</a> and <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/578/woohoo-seven-hundred-days-in-beta?lq=1"">what problems you face</a>.</p>
<p>So,</p>
<h3>Here's what we're doing immediately:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>We'll be removing the &quot;beta&quot; label</strong>. The site will keep the same (clean, professional) theme, but there's no need for the stigma.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>We'll be appointing two more moderators.</strong> In addition to providing some much-needed support for <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/118/moderator-pro-tem-announcement"">the existing Pro Tempore mods</a>, these trusted users will hopefully be well-equipped to help guide and introduce new users. <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/review-beta/first-posts/"">This isn't something that <em>requires</em> a moderator</a>, but it is something we've found - particularly on smaller sites - that folks are often more comfortable doing with that diamond next to their name.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>And here's what we're doing in the future:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Continued periodic quality evaluations</strong>. A <em>little bit</em> of structured introspection can be invaluable in identifying trouble spots, as well as strengths - both important for a growing site. We'll be working on better tooling for this as well.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Taking a hard look at the timeline for introducing the various changes associated with graduation.</strong> Some of these - putting together a solid design for instance - require a lot of work. Others - reputation levels, some forms of promotion - don't. <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/455/help-design-an-ad-to-promote-the-site-during-tax-season"">We've already experimented with some of this</a>, and seen some decent results. If you come up with a novel idea, don't hesitate to suggest it here.</p>
</li>

<p>Sorry. I know this rambles on a bit, but we've been accused of... being a <em>bit</em> less-than-up-front about this stuff in the past, and I want you to understand the reasoning behind it. We put a lot of work into tracking the progress of these sites behind the scenes, and frankly that needs to be a bit more transparent. Aarthi should be writing up the results of the recent quality eval shortly as well, and we'll keep you posted on the status of the changes I outlined above.</p>
<p>Until then, thanks for sticking it out here and helping to make the Internet a better place for personal finance information.</p>

645,4165,-1,1,,5,,136,0,0,,,Self-Evaluation Feedback: Personal Finance and Moving Forward,<discussion>,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>Unlike most other evaluations, I actually took the time to do a deep-dive evaluation for your site. (For those questioning my fitness to do this, I'm a graduate of one of the top business schools in the US. I know enough to be dangerous, as one of my professors liked to say.) Comparing findings, I saw that the community and I mostly agreed on what was/wasn't a good questions, with a couple of divergences.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<p>The key takeaways from my analysis of your questions were:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>This site excels most when the questions are specific.</strong> I noticed that the specific questions received not only the highest amount of participation from our established users, but also proved to be the ones that had us showing up better in Google search results.</li>
<li><strong>We don't excel at definition questions.</strong> This is in large part due to the large amount of competition in the personal finance market. It's going to be impossible to beat Wikipedia, Investopedia, or any of the other static sites that provide basic financial terminology information.</li>
<li><strong>Mathematical formatting is difficult to read.</strong> While math formulas are rarely needed on PFM (usually they're brought up in relation to TVM questions) the occasions where they <em>are</em> needed are obvious. I would have loved to see the mortgage vs. invest question from the last evaluation have the top answer edited to have the formula formatted in LaTeX or even in MS Word's equation editor. It would have taken little time and would have made that question infinitely more readable.</li>
<li><strong>Comments aren't answers.</strong> I saw several times a succinct, excellent answer <em>left as a comment!</em> No! Don't allow this. Comment back and suggest to the person that they convert their comment into an answer. Alternatively, <em>turn the comment into an answer yourself!</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Community Engagement and Question Quality</h2>
<p>Now, as far as your community is concerned, there are some things that came up.</p>
<h3>The Good:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Questions aren't over-answered.</strong> With an answered rate of 98% and an average of 2.6 answers per question, this means that most questions get enough of an answer for the asker to be satisfied, but not so many that new users feel powerless to respond to anything at all without repeating themselves. (This is the <em>opposite</em> of a forum, where everyone is happy to repeat the same points made before.)</li>
<li><strong>Traffic is on the up and up.</strong> Over the last six months, your traffic numbers have increased significantly. I've been the person most consistently doing your evaluations; my observations indicate that this number is up from what it was at the beginning of this year. Part of what helped was most certainly the tax ad we put up on the network back in March/April.</li>
<li><strong>Question quality is good.</strong> For the most part, this evaluation revealed that, the majority of the time, we are doing <em>as well or better than</em> the rest of the internet at answering questions about personal finance topics.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Bad</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your user retention is low.</strong> This isn't something you can directly affect (though the following two points should help with this) but it's worth bearing in mind. Your attrition rate is high: <em>half of all users with less than 1,000 reputation</em> are effectively one-and-done, &quot;drive-by&quot; users. By that, I mean they are people who will ask one question, nod in understanding (maybe even upvote), and then peace out. It's a challenge this site will face for the entirety of its existence.</li>
<li><strong>Needs more community moderation.</strong> This means more editing, as well as more closing, more voting to close/reopen, and more flagging. Take for example <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/16232/do-banks-accept-a-large-gift-to-me-as-a-valid-down-payment-for-a-house"">the answer here</a>. Dilip's answer is <em>excellent</em>, but I would have loved to see someone link directly to the tax code. It would have pushed this answer past the edge a little bit to be <em>as amazing as possible</em>. I felt like adding citations to law or tax code, pictures, a chart, and all sorts of small extras to posts would have improved their readability and presentation immensely. I'd love to see more community collaboration on posts this way. I'd also love to see more of the usual moderation, too, as after 2-3 years of existence you've got a huge base of questions and answers and knowledge to draw from.</li>
<li><strong>Small scale promo work would be amazing.</strong> I'm not talking about renting billboard time in Times Square -- I'm talking something as simple as <a href=""http://reddit.com/r/money"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">posting interesting questions/answers in <code>/r/money</code></a>. Yes, Reddit isn't exactly the best way to get people on board, but I know more than a few people involved in finance (personal and professional) who spend hours each day surfing Reddit. It'd be a great way to bring in people who would otherwise be wasting time on The Motley Fool boards. It would also be a great way to see if we can push the boundary between QF and PFM.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>I'd like to see this community's questions per day stat go up. I'd also like to see more community moderation. I'd also love to see people starting to take a hard look at older questions, see what needs some tidying. I'd love to see some low-level community promotion from things as simple as posting to Reddit or newsgroups or finance course forums and mailing lists. If you regularly read a finance blog, comment on their entries more and then maybe pass along an interesting questions link (using the <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/greatest-hits"">list of greatest hits questions</a> is always a great place to start!) could make a major thing happen.</p>
<p>Look, I won't pretend I haven't been extremely critical of this site in my previous evaluations. I've done my best to place myself in the shoes of Random Internet Person and look at this site from a demanding perspective. Before this evaluation, this community was consistently found <em>wanting</em>. This is the first evaluation where I can say that you all exceeded my expectations. Your growth has been consistent, your question quality improved significantly, and I was happy to see more people commenting and voting on this evaluation than on the last.</p>
<p>We're very happy to see how much progress and improvement you've all made in the last six months. I, for one, sincerely hope that you all choose <em>not</em> to rest on your laurels. Instead, strive to make this site 1% better in some way, large or small, <em>every single day</em>. I truly believe that, with time, this site could be an unparalleled resource for personal finance questions on the internet.</p>

650,312,-1,2,,2,510,,,2,,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I don't think the advanced trading questions are on topic for this site.  I think the simple questions are on topic, but some line needs to be drawn between personal finance and the details of trading.  The techniques of trading are a topic that has spanned many tomes and has many professional or vocational practitioners, as such it's not really a personal finance question.  </p>

<p>On the other hand this raises the question of how do we tell what's advanced and what's not, which is a difficult line to draw.  I don't think we should simply rule out options as that is a fairly common tactic for individual investors.  However there is obviously a line between that and ""Algorithmic trading in linux using python"" and ""Difference between Black-Scholes, Binomial models and Market price in European index options?"".  These are highly specific questions that I doubt individual investors will be asking.  I also think that we want to stay away from the line with <a href=""https://quant.stackexchange.com/"">Quantitative Finance</a>. </p>

of the settings in Quicken or some on the bank's web site, and
this, to my mind, is a programming or interfacing issue, and not

654,3,,2,,1,653,,,0,,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>My thoughts:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Generally, I'm OK with the following things you listed as being considered off-topic: <em>algorithmic trading</em>, <em>technical models</em>, <em>math of technical models</em>, and <em>historical analysis</em>.  Of course, this is my opinion because I hardly practice any of those things. :)</p></li>
<li><p>I don't think we should say all <strong>options</strong> questions are off-topic.  The subject should be sub-divided. I suggest that <em>basic</em> option trades like buying calls, buying puts, writing calls, and writing puts should be on-topic subject matter, because many individual investors employ such techniques, even if they're not 100% sure about how they work &mdash; and that's why we're here.</p>

<p>For instance, the larger an individual's portfolio, the more likely such an investor may be using puts to protect against downside risk, and covered calls to generate premium income.</p>

<p>We should also acknowledge the legions who sometimes speculate on individual stocks using call options for leverage. I know more than a few non-finance people who've bought AAPL&nbsp;CALL-100* contracts with hopes of riches. &nbsp;  <em>*Substitute any popular stock-du-jour for AAPL.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, <strong>forex</strong> (for our purposes) ought to be clarified to mean investing or speculating <strong><em>directly</em></strong> in currencies or currency instruments (futures contracts or other derivatives) with a view to profit from any difference in currency prices.</p>

<p>That is, I suggest we <em>permit</em> general questions about currency exchange from an online or cross-border consumer, traveler, or expat perspective.  There will also be cases where currency is a concern within investing.  Consider the common case of a Canadian purchasing U.S.-listed stock, or an American dealing on the LSE for a company that hasn't yet interlisted or issued ADRs.</p></li>
<li><p>You didn't mention <strong>commodities</strong>.  e.g. trading futures in crude oil, wheat, lumber, pork bellies?  On the surface I'm leaning towards off-topic, but then gold and silver come to mind and I'm not sure how we can draw a line for commodities.  I'm interested in opinions on this one.  e.g. Commodity ETFs OK, but future contracts, not?</p></li>

We want to attract advanced money people here, and sticking to basic trades and topics (like I make) might not do the trick.  I think a broker would be a great user, whereas an Quantitative analysis researcher is not.</p>

<p>So long as an individual can do the advanced trade legally, then the question is valid for personal finance. </p>

<h2>Off topic questions would be</h2>

<li>Things people simply cannot do without being a large institution or regulated industry.</li>
<li>Calculations that predict outcomes (or creating equations)</li>

<h2>On topic questions could be</h2>

<li>Calculations that compare items (using equations)</li>
<li>Any kind of trade that I can do with my broker.</li>

<p>On one hand some terrific bloggers provide awesome help with Excel, on the other I see equations meant to bend space and time.</p>

<p>Really anything that a common online broker interface lets you do should be good here.  I am a Ronco style investor (set it and forget it) , but I know I can get an account for trade currency, so that is on topic.  But the clever folks that can use tactics and tools to buy and sell are welcome and on topic.</p>

<p>Finally, we should dovetail our definition of on topic with the definition of off topic on the Quant site.  That would make it clearer.</p>

662,5760,-1,2,,5,661,,,2,,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I think the question <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/18242/are-401k-fees-based-on-contribution-amounts-or-total-account-balance-whats-r"">Are 401(k) fees based on contribution amounts or total account balance? What&#39;s reasonable?</a> actually is a two-part question, the first of which asks how 401k fees are assessed and the second asks whether the fees charged to the OP's account are reasonable. 
In my opinion, neither of these two questions is a localized question.
Since there were no votes to close from the readership, and the question(s)
had received an answer from the person with the highest reputation on 
money.SE, consideration of the question as a candidate for closing on
the grounds that it is <em>too localized</em> is
somewhat premature.  Note that if this question is to be closed as
<em>temporally</em> local, then <em>any</em> question on taxes or IRAs etc
should be closed as well since the answer would be in terms of tax law
or IRA rules as they are for that year, and thus not of any use to 
readers a few years down the road.</p>

<p>I also think that the <em>edits</em> have added a whole slew of additional questions
most of which are unanswerable. For example, there is no <em>market</em> for 401k plans and no competition. An employee is restricted to <em>contributing</em> to a 401k
plan of the employer. If the 401k plan is not to the employee's liking for
some reason (high fees, poor investment choices, whatever), the options
are to not contribute at all, or to find a job with another employer.
401k plans do not list their fees on <em>public</em> web sites but provide
this information on web sites restricted to the participants. Many major
firms run <em>several</em> different 401k plans for different employers with
different fee structures for each, and so any information on, say
Vanguard's, public site, is at best generic information.  Thus, the
demand in the edited question for links to specific web sites is
unlikely to be met. Similarly, I believe that it is a requirement of
US tax law that each 401k plan report annually to each participant on
the performance of the participant's account as well as the performance 
of each investment vehicle (mutual fund), and the fees and fee structure.
I do not know whether the second and third items have to be reported to
the IRS, but there is, to the best of my knowledge, no public
disclosure of the second and third items.</p>

<p>In short, I think the original question was fine while the
edited version might be worth considering for closure as unanswerable!</p>

No one is going to effectively do HFT as part of personal finance. There are many reasons for this, but the most straightforward is that it isn't feasible, in terms of required infrastructure. It might even be irresponsible to encourage people to believe otherwise. Yes, there are special cases of very wealthy individuals, but they should get advice on this elsewhere than here, rather than from us. </p>

<p><strong>""Algorithmic trading""</strong> is less clear-cut. I realize that the <strong><a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/13671/algorithmic-trading-in-linux-using-python"" title=""Algorithmic trading in Linux using Python"">particular question</a></strong> (it was the last on the list in the question here on meta Money) was asking only about a test platform, but the fact that the question was so specific, wanted Linux, Python, whatever else, is rather localized.</p>

<p>Second consideration about algorithmic trading: While it isn't necessarily high-speed, it <strong>does</strong> require expensive/specialized resources. We might want to consider whether it is likely to be a realistic endeavor for any small individual investor. I found <strong><a href=""http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~abrock/algotrading/page5.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""AlgoTrading Platform Implementation and Diagram"">this page</a></strong> (it is a web site mentioned by one of the answers to that Linux-related algo trading question, from Carnegie-Mellon Stats dept, not sure if a student or staff). Take a look at the suggested configuration, and the recommendation for maximum latency time for algo trading. Maybe that is feasible for some users of this site, I'm truly not sure.</p>

<p>Given changes in financial markets of late, perhaps it will be more realistic in the future, even if it isn't now. I'm not saying that that thought makes me happy! I'm merely mentioning it as a possibility, depending on evolving regulation etc.</p>

<p>As I write this, my blog currently has a grand total of 3 posts so I would barely refer to myself as a blogger yet.  That being said, it was whilst doing some research for an upcoming blog post that I discovered this site from a search.  As a programmer who has relied on StackOverflow for years, I'm surprised I didn't come across it sooner, but I'm glad I've found it now.</p>

<p>I read @mbhunter's answer with great interest, and I shared @MrChrister's surprise  at the meta links @mbhunter gave.</p>

<p>I decided to start my blog because I had to make an important decision about how to invest my money and I was alarmed at how difficult it was to get answers to the questions I had.  I consider myself a very financially literate person and if it was this difficult for me to get the answers I needed, how must other people feel.</p>

<p>The whole point of my blog is/will be to answer questions that I struggled with in the hope that others will find it useful.  Sure, I might make some small amount of money from advertising if it becomes successful, but that's not my motivation for doing it.</p>

<p>By contributing my knowledge here, I get the same chance to help people where I may know something they need an answer to and as a side benefit it may help to promote my blog.  I've only been on the site for a few days and I haven't mentioned my blog anywhere except for my profile page and I've already had a couple of click-throughs to my site.  Seeing that happen really encouraged me to contribute more and see if there were other answers I could help with.</p>

<p>I see the two things as very much complementary.  My blog will be serving a very specific niche of expat investors and will probably never generate much traffic as a result.  The articles I'll be publishing will also be covering a lot of detail and would be far too much information to use as the answer to a question here.</p>

<p>Contributing to this site gives me a way to reach a larger audience than I would if I focused purely on my own blog.  I can help people who need answers and if somebody asks a question about something I've written an article about which I think they may find useful then being able to provide a link to that post (as part of a good answer) should be mutually beneficial.  The OP gets their question answered and can read my article if they want to understand the subject in more detail, and my fledgling blog gets help in attracting readers who are actually interested in the subject matter.</p>

<p>The FAQ position of allowing links to blog posts only where relevant to the question and doing so in moderation seems fair and reasonable to me.  IMHO, suggestions like @MrChrister's of having affiliated blogger tags or guest bloggers would go a long way to encouraging more people like myself to contribute to this site.  (Assuming you actually want more people like myself that is!).</p>

<p>Either way there is a problem here. The the issue with closing the question is, is it too localized. That doesn't appear to be the case, as VMMXX isn't a local issue. Given the number of users who use Vanguard here, that would be like saying the Java NIO package is too localized for Stackoverflow.

<p>A couple of these types of questions have been closed in the past, but we don't have anything in the <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/faq"">FAQ</a> yet and I'd like to raise this kind of question to FAQ-level as off-topic.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The FAQ's ""don't ask"" section now has a point for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Requests for specific service provider recommendations; e.g. asking where to get a loan, what broker to use, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Feel free to comment/answer if you think the text above could be better worded.</p>

In my answer to this question and other similar questions, I have tried to focus on the differences, pros and cons of different investment strategies and asset classes, as well as the suitability to the questioner's specific circumstances. On a secondary note, there is no formal liability for investment advice provided on a non-professional basis.</p>

<p>However, in the same way that we wouldn't want someone to seek or decline medical treatment based on a non-professional diagnosis of their medical condition, I wouldn't want someone to buy or sell assets based on the knowledge we are sharing with them here. Hopefully, that would be a starting point for them better understand their options and begin their own research.</p>

<p>I don't see a problem with sharing the general risks and benefits of certain asset classes, or with explaining general principles of investment. I think the important thing is to explain <em>why</em> we think something may be a good or poor fit, as everyone's situation is different.</p>

<p>Is there a policy for this? Based on my limited understanding of the SE system, I see several options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Vote to close the question on money.SE and simply ignore it from there.</li>
<li>Flag the question for moderator attention and have it deleted from this site. </li>
<li>Copy the answer from quant.SE to an answer on money.SE. I would make my answer community wiki (I don't get reputation for it then, I think). I would copy the text of the answer from quant.SE verbatim, with a citation to the poster's comment and the quant.SE answer. </li>
<li>???</li>

Because the questions are worded differently, I don't see an SEO penalty for either site.  So if a search leads a user here, and they find the link to the good answer an Quant, then problem solved!  The internet answered a question correctly for somebody.</p>

<p>But I would prefer to delete it altogether and save that user a click.  That way a users who Googles with Bing will get a direct link to the answer they seek.  You are very right about link rot, so removing the content that can go bad is better for us and for the Internet.</p>

<p>My question is:</p>

<p><strong>What kinds of Bitcoin questions should be acceptable at the Personal Finance &amp; Money Stack Exchange</strong>, if any?  Can a case be made for <em>some</em> Bitcoin questions being on-topic here, and others being off-topic, or should we expect the Bitcoin SE to handle all Bitcoin-related questions?</p>

<p>Your thoughts are appreciated.</p>

<ul>
<li>Upper and lower bounds of the amount of bitcoins?

<ul>

</ul></li>
<li>What exactly are Bitcoins &amp; how can you make use of them online?

<ul>
<li>Off-topic</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What problem is BitCoin solving?

<ul>
<li>On-topic</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How does someone get bitcoins?

<ul>
<li>On-topic</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What does ""high"" and ""low"" mean on the Bitcoin market?

<ul>
<li>Sort of on-topic, but we'd rather see it go elsewhere</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How much is one BitCoin really worth?

<ul>
<li>Not even close to on-topic</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Can BitCoin eventually become mainstream? Will it raise legal/economical issues?

<ul>
<li>The ""mainstream"" bit is questionable but the legal/economic issues part is on-topic</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>As a general rule we tend towards the technical side of Bitcoin Q&amp;A and will grudgingly answer questions on the economic side, but if the question is economic in nature and could be generalized to other assets (gold/silver/Euros/pork belly futures) we'd prefer it be asked on a site populated more by economists than cryptographers - if only for the sake of users getting better answers.</p>

<p>That said, there are a handful of econ questions that are entirely unique to Bitcoin, mostly because of its completely transparent nature and the related fact that we have access to statistics that simply don't exist for other assets. Those questions are entirely on-topic and absolutely welcome at Bitcoin.SE.</p>

I'd say you should probably welcome questions that deal with Bitcoins in the context of personal finance but not questions that deal with the mechanics or internals of Bitcoin itself. This rule would make pretty much all of the questions mentioned off topic.</p>

<p>For example, questions that might be on topic would include questions about Bitcoins as an investment, tax implications of trading Bitcoins, assessing risks associated with holding Bitcoins, using Bitcoins to hedge against inflation, consumer issues with paying for things using Bitcoins, and so on.</p>

We continue to reject questions that are limited in scope. This currency has fewer than 100K users (the bitcoin Wiki showed 60K about 18 months ago) and whose total value is under $2B. </p>

<p>The questions that are cited as off topic for the bitcoin.SE strike me as not on topic here either. Just my two cents. Now that I'd shared my thoughts, there's likely to be a question phrased just right that it's of interest to me. </p>

<p>Edit - I'm going to add that there appears enough controversy that any discussion that starts out as legitimate will easily go off to a tangent of debate. The comments on the question here are an example of this. BC questions here will keep the Mods busy. If this is a vote, I'm voting off-topic. </p>

Victor is a valuable poster with good reputation and a significant number of great answers and comments.</p>

<p>His advice often leads to back-and-forth debates in comments. For example, <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/21475/what-does-the-term-match-the-market-mean/21477#21477"">here</a> and <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/20998/why-is-the-dominant-investing-advice-for-individuals-to-use-mfs-etfs-etc/20999#comment28606_20999"">here</a>.</p>

While there are exceptions to everything, once comments get meta (commenting about comments) I view them negatively.  Two people having a discussion or argument below a question only dilutes the value of what they are ""commenting"" on.</p>

<p>I wouldn't suggest automatically deleting comments on other comments, but I would suggest that 4 or more back and forth exchanges get seriously considered for deletion. Once each person as said something twice, off to the chat it should go.</p>

<li>Comments on the answer or question are valuable, especially if they offer dissent</li>

The back and forth comments are a distraction, and should be kept to a minimum. I think it's for the user to know when to stop, and that failing, the mods are doing a good job cleaning things up. 
In most cases, trying to keep this general, there's a line where those going on should just 'agree to disagree.' </p>

<p>I believe Dheer is exactly correct, with some additions.</p>

<p>Pestering folks to accept your answer is fine; it reenforces the norms of the site.  Our goal is to make the internet a better place, and we have rules and culture to support that mission.  If a new users doesn't want to play by those rules, they don't have to, but they won't feel completely welcomed either.  (Getting pestered to accept an answer might not be fun).  Having a consistent culture makes the community stronger and focused.  The benefits of a focused community is getting consistently high volumes of traffic to the site.</p>

<p>Consider the interested players in the site:</p>

<ul>
<li>StackExchange corporate wants pageviews.  The more visitor, the more ads they can sell for a higher price.  </li>
<li>The visitors want good answers on a site that is legible.  Voting should bring those good answers to the top, and an answer also promotes it.</li>
<li>Members of the site want reputation and a good community to ""discuss"" their passion.</li>
</ul>

<p>These goals are very aligned in output.  Reputation is the gamification of the site; the means to an end.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>To achieve their goal, StackExchange needs content.  Since most people won't be digital sharecroppers for free, the points system acts as motivation for great users (such as yourself) to provide content.</p></li>
<li><p>The users get to have good, generally trustworthy answers they can be quickly evaluated.  The site is pleasant to read, loads fast, and well placed in search engines.  </p></li>
<li><p>Those who want to stick around get to play games of reputation.  The site of experts also provides personal growth in areas that really interest them.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>All of that ends up as a community that can make the Internet a better place.  So feel free to <s>pester folks</s> <strong>ask once</strong> to accept the answer.  <strong>That just happens to be how this community works</strong>.</p>

729,868,,2,,3,726,,,2,,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I suggest that you do not prod them much.  Let 'em be.  If they understand what this is all about, they will accept those answers that they feel are correct.  If they don't understand, you want them touching as little as possible.</p>

<p>Not all questions can be answered, so there shouldn't an expectation that every question will have an accepted answer.</p>

<p>The perspective is incorrect.  Who says <strong>your</strong> answer is correct?  If anything, they should be prodded to select an answer that they feel is correct, if one is available.  Pestering them to accept your answer is incorrect.</p>

<p>An accepted answer is worth 15 rep.  An up-vote is worth 10.  Up-votes outstrip accepted answers by a long shot.  We shouldn't worry too much about having accepted answers.  </p>

<p>Overall, they are good and are to be encouraged.  However, I see little value in pestering people about something relatively trivial.  People should be encouraged to accept answers, but no hounded to do it.  There's already at least one discussion about this on the main meta somewhere.</p>

<p>Nobody on Money.SE is ever fooled.  In fact all of the answers call out the scam and believing the best in everybody, offer advice and a critical analysis to avoid getting into trouble.</p>

<p>While the Mods have done a new job getting rid of link bait and useless posts, there is an idea that keeping around the obvious scam question, with a really good ""don't get scammed"" answer has value for the Internet.  That we can provide the ""canonical"" response to garbage emails and Internet posts.</p>

<p>There is the alternate view that Money.SE isn't going to solve the scam issue, and anybody with the wherewithal to search the Internet for advice on a potential scam isn't going to get fooled.  Therefore, Money.SE should delete those posts to focus on what we do best (personal finance)</p>

Arguably, these answers are <em>adding value to the internet</em> at large with their existence. And, protecting oneself from spam/false creditors <em>is</em> a part of personal finance. </p>

735,91,,2,,0,732,,,1,,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>Just to offer a contrary opinion:</p>

<p>I would suggest maintaining a single post about scams.  Perhaps a wiki question and answer dedicated to deciphering a scam and pointing out the obvious clues to watch for:</p>

<ul>
<li>too good to be true</li>
<li>only deal face to face</li>
<li>somebody you don't know wouldn't contact you</li>
<li>uncommon ways of transferring money</li>
<li>why cashiers checks are not trustworthy</li>
<li>etc...</li>

<p>Then anything that comes in and is clearly a scam or about a scam just gets closed as a duplicate to that giant wiki answer.  Being a wiki, every time it is closed as a duplicate, the community or the votes can update the answer (if needed) to reenforce the point.</p>

<p>This way the duplicate questions don't have to be redundantly answered, a good trustworthy resource is on the web.  And this site can focus on answering real questions.  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>In a recent <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/a/21874/7590"">answer</a> involving data sources, I copied a small list of links to government statistical agencies and central banks that often compile data; it's relevant to the question, but I've answered other questions that could benefit from similar information. </p></li>
<li><p>I've seen a few questions, similar to <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/q/21121/7590"">this one</a> asking about financial statements. I recently found that the Wikipedia page of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">S&amp;P500 components</a> contains links, for every company, to their financial statements in EDGAR. I find this very useful. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Currently, these are my only specific examples, but is there a place where general, potentially useful information like this could go? The only options I can think of are a) the tag wiki, if a relevant tag exists, b) a self-answered question, although for point 1, I'm not sure what form that would take, if any, or c) the answer to any question where it's relevant. </p>

<p>I shy away from c) because at least with my answers, I tend to update them as time goes by with newer links, charts, etc. so I can see some of them falling out of sync. Alternatively, these two examples may not be great examples of general information that should be maintained anywhere and is best ignored for the time being. </p>

<p>Essentially, if you asked a question and it isn't getting very much attention, the first thing you should do is try and make it a <em>better question</em>.  Once you've done that, another option is the <strong>bounty</strong>.  A bounty involves offering up some of your own reputation as additional incentive to get a question answered.</p>

<p>You can start a bounty on your own questions (most common), and even on questions asked by other people, perhaps on interesting but <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/unanswered"">unanswered questions</a> you can't answer yourself.</p>

<p>One requirement for adding a bounty is that the question be at least two days old. If a question is eligible to have a bounty, you'll notice a <em>""start bounty""</em> link under the question's comments.  (It's a small link, easy to miss.)  You also must have at least 75 reputation.</p>

<p>As a demonstration of this feature we, your moderators, have started bounties on a handful of open questions that we think deserve more attention.  You'll find questions having a bounty on the <strong><a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/?tab=featured"">Featured</a></strong> page for 7 days.  They'll also appear in the regular question lists with a special icon displaying the outstanding bounty amount.</p>

I am not a lawyer however.</p>

<p>Moreover, I wouldn't want to actually write the words of a disclaimer, and unless StackExchange Inc has some boilerplate, it might be more harm than good (again, I am not a lawyer and it isn't my money).  Perhaps an actual SE employee should give us the corporate stance.</p>

<p>Littleadv is a very thorough and accurate poster.  I think the same sort of mindset that drives him to write a disclaimer every time is exactly the mindset that gives him the ability to reference specific US Tax documents in his post.  Some people are just very <em>complete</em> thinkers.  No big deal to read his disclaimers; plus he is technically correct.  This is an advice site, but we get what we pay for.</p>

<p>Finally, I think that Littleadv is smart in that people are likely to only read the post if the come from The Googles or The Bings.  Members of the site will read the FAQ, but a generic user won't, so the disclaimer needs to be in each answer for a drive by visitor to see it.</p>

750,2998,,2,,6,747,,,2,,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>The reason I put this disclaimer is because these questions are very specific and my answer may be considered by some as a ""tax advice"". I don't want to get a lawsuit in the mail from some idiot who didn't read the instructions just because I was nice enough to answer a question.</p>

<p>Giving an answer that is detailed and specific to the question asked may make an <em>incorrect</em> impression that I am licensed and I am a practitioner - <strong>which I am not</strong>. Where I suspect such an impression can occur - I explicitly add the disclaimer, to make sure no misinterpretation is being made. I do this on this forum, on OnStartups, and anywhere else I write.</p>

<p>Many times I also suggest to talk to professionals, and there were occasions where I preferred not to write the answer in order to emphasize the need to go to a professional - these question I vote on as off-topic.</p>

<p>A ""general"" disclaimer will definitely help for the writers' (and the site managers) legal protection, but unless explicitly mentioned in the answer I doubt anyone will notice it until pointed out by a lawyer. What I would like to have instead is an ability to add a constant signature to answers so that I wouldn't have to write this disclaimer over and over again.</p>

Specifically, I noticed that the reputation thresholds for privilege levels are higher on <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/privileges"">graduated sites</a> than <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/privileges"">this site</a>. The main meta <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/160292/218097"">confirms this</a>. </p>

<p>Since privileges aren't <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/139433/218097"">grandfathered in</a> when the site graduates, there might be a few users with less than 2000 reputation who review suggested edits/low quality posts now, but will lose that ability once the site graduates, as well as people with less than 10,000 reputation who use the moderator tools now to look for spam or view deleted questions, but will lose that privilege when the site graduates.</p>

<p><em>Assuming</em> the site gets more attention once it graduates and <em>assuming</em> this attention is coupled with more suggested edits, more spam, etc. could this create a problem? I think the moderators/high-rep users are doing a <strong>great</strong> job at the moment, but I saw the possibility of more work being put on fewer people so I thought I'd bring it up. </p>

<p>Maybe it just means that instead of <em>x</em> minutes between reviews, there will be <em>2x</em> minutes between them, and maybe more attention will bring more users to help with these tasks. In those cases, there won't be a problem, I don't think.</p>

773,9379,9379,2,,4,771,,,3,,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>Short answer - no. You've got plenty of engaged users at or above the 2 - 3k reputation level that it should not be an issue. Additionally, this site tends to retain engaged users rather well. To put it in perspective, your 10k users don't go a month without visiting the site at least once. </p>

<p>Also, you'll have your first community elected moderation team keeping a watchful eye on things, and you'll elect these folks based partly on the time they spend doing moderation tasks <em>now</em>. I'm certain you'll do a fine job of putting, or keeping some of the most effective members of your community at their post.</p>

<p>Part of our criteria for graduation is to be sure that a site can sustain an election, and determining that naturally brings our focus to what will happen when the privilege scale shifts. If we had any doubt that you could handle it, we would have been much more hesitant. Also, don't forget - we (Stack Exchange) will continue to keep a close eye on things even after you graduate. </p>

<p>For example, a person describing something that he/she did that might be illegal in some way - we should not attempt to answer, and we should not encourage the OP to elaborate and provide further details. Attorney-client communication is privileged, and so is CPA-client in non-criminal issues, but OP-forum communication is not.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I've seen questions where people specifically ask whether something is legal, OK, or not, and argue with responders requesting substantiation. While easier and more standard mainstream situations can be substantiated easily by amateurs like us - more complicated issues cannot, and by attempting doing so we may cause the OP damage (even if in the end we will not be liable because of all the disclaimers and IANALs, still - there may be some damaged caused because the OP is too cheap to talk to a lawyer).</p>

<p>I personally vote to close for this reason quite often, and I'd appreciate a standard text to show the OP the right direction in these cases (as my own words may seem too harsh occasionally to some).</p>

801,10512,10512,1,,22,,546,6,10,,,Design for Personal Finance & Money,<discussion><design>,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>My name is <a href=""http://www.emblematiq.com/about/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lucian</a> and, together with the Stack Exchange team, I will be in charge of creating the new design for the Personal Finance &amp; Money site, as it graduates from the beta phase. While the site will have its own theme to reflect its topic and culture, it will still share certain common elements with the rest of its Stack Exchange family.</p>

<p>The main idea behind the new design is to provide an accurate representation of the topic, infused with the character of the community as it exists under the Stack Exchange umbrella. The overall theme is that of an official financial document by borrowing visual elements common to banknotes, bonds, legal stationery, and other similar materials. Additional financial metaphors spread throughout serve as quick reminders and help achieve a cohesive and distinct look.</p>

<h1>Logo</h1>

<p>The logo uses one of the ubiquitous symbols when it comes to personal finance – the piggy bank. Its connotations are immediate but they’re not as rigid or corporate as other common financial symbols. It has a friendlier, more accessible side that speaks to the community aspect powering the site.</p>

<p>On its own, a piggy bank symbol may not provide enough differentiation but the idea was to make it Stack Exchange’s piggy bank. This is achieved by incorporating visual cues to the main Stack Exchange symbol – the three horizontal lines and angled ears. Adding additional style elements reinforce its uniqueness and the end result relates both to the subject and the community’s presence and role within its larger family. </p>

<p>The type treatment maintains the theme by suggesting the combination of a signature with a heavy, banknote-like visual making use of <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=Siderography%20shading&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">siderography</a> (the steel engraving process used for currency and old fashioned stocks) effect.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yyNQ3.jpg"" alt=""Personal Finance &amp; Money logo""></p>

<p>Taken separately or as a whole, the symbol and type work to establish the overall brand of the Personal Finance &amp; Money site. They can also work as outside community ambassadors, with various degrees of supporting elements.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/nPZ9A.jpg"" alt=""Money business card""></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/n16An.jpg"" alt=""Money t-shirt""></p>

<h1>Site Design</h1>

<p><em>(please click on the images below to view in full resolution)</em></p>

<p>The visuals here continue the overall theme by using cues from official monetary documents.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vCfjC.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vCfjC.jpg"" alt=""Money.se home page""></a></p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tsHgS.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tsHgS.jpg"" alt=""Money.se question page""></a></p>

<p>Commonly used on banknotes, <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=Guilloche&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Guilloche patterns</a> make up the primary background visuals for the site’s header and various other areas. They are complemented by various other graphic treatments that include financial references, such as solid full color blocks, clear dividers, and trend lines.</p>

<p>Because such elements can easily become overpowering through their complexity, I have tried to minimize their usage and employ them in more subtle ways throughout.</p>

<p>The typography maintains the theme of an official document by setting some elements in a bold, condensed, gothic inspired typeface that creates a classic, business-like feel. Again, the effect is used in moderation so it doesn’t overwhelm and does not affect legibility.</p>

<p>Finally, for the color palette, while keeping with the official look and feel, I’ve tried to make it as generic as possible so it doesn’t necessarily reflect one particular currency or geographic area. The global was to match and reinforce the global reach of the community.</p>

<p>The mockups above do not contain all the site elements, but they should give you a good idea of the overall look and feel of the design. I would love to hear your feedback. If there are no major design changes, we would like to launch the site very soon.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>Based on your feedback, I have updated the design of the up/down arrows and included a new mockup below. If there are no other major issues, we can move forward with making this design a reality.

<ul>
<li><p>The up / down icons don't give me enough of a sense of up and down.  The angle makes it feel weird.  I wonder if a new user, unfamiliar with the overall stackexchange UX, would intuitively the voting.  Just a simple up/down might be an improvement, or increasing the angle of arrows.</p></li>
<li><p>Is a piggy bank international enough?  We get a pretty high percentage of user from outside the U.S. and will a piggy bank grab them the same way?  I don't know enough about the other cultures.  (For me is a great!  I know this would be a major change and it might be too late.)</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, I know nothing of scale! But the tags are more important to our site than their size relative to the rest of the question.  Tagging questions with a country is very important for a good answer here and I wish they were a bit more prominent under the question.</p></li>

806,3,3,2,,13,801,,,9,,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>It's a great design!  Thank you, Lucian!</p>

<p>I have some subjective feedback.  While I do have a handful of tweaks to suggest, each is minor.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In the header, I like the different font treatment for <em>""personal finance""</em> vs. <em>""money""</em>.  Yet, we tend to emphasize personal finance questions over questions related simply to money. Could ""personal finance"" be made more prominent relative to ""money""?  Perhaps just shrink ""money"" a bit?  (And, FWIW, the ampersand seems a bit too big for the job it is doing.)</p></li>
<li><p>I really like the piggy bank.  I'm sure most cultures have a concept for a box to save money in, and <a href=""http://thefinancialbrand.com/24204/history-of-piggy-banks/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the piggy bank is a great example</a> known by many.  I appreciate that the piggy bank places an emphasis on saving.  As for the bars inside: they seem spaced a little too far apart to be seen as a ""stack"", and too close to the pig's edges.  How about tightening them up, a bit closer together?  e.g.:</p>

<p><em>Original:</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UsqmA.png"" alt=""Originally proposed piggy bank icon""> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Tweaked:</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IzR8N.png"" alt=""Piggy bank icon with tighter-packed stack""></p>

<p><em><sup>(though, without messing up the dithered pixels like I did with my quick &amp; dirty edit.)</sup></em></p></li>
<li><p>I suggest making the <strong>""Ask Question""</strong> link more prominent.  I see the underline on close inspection, but even so, the link doesn't stand out as much as it ought to, perhaps owing to the all-caps used for all the links on that line.  Maybe lighten the other links, or darken this one? Or something else to help it stand out more.  It stands out well enough in the beta theme we have now because the font weight is obviously heavier.</p></li>
<li><p>I agree with @MrChrister and @C.Ross that the voting buttons tend not to afford voting. Perhaps make the up &amp; down chart arrow directions more prominently vertical? Or, lose the ""volatility"" part of the chart arrow? Alternatively, how about <em>plus</em> and <em>minus</em> glyphs similar to calculator buttons, instead of up/down arrows?  Examples of each:</p>

<p>More vertical:&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/15WlJ.png"" alt=""Voting buttons with chart arrow angled more vertically""> &nbsp;&nbsp;
No ""volatility"":&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/OMuyp.png"" alt=""Voting buttons with chart arrow having no &quot;volatility&quot;""> &nbsp;&nbsp;
Plus/minus glyphs:&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VCR3b.png"" alt=""Voting buttons with &quot;plus&quot; and &quot;minus&quot; calculator-style glyphs instead""></p></li>
<li><p>The colours for the gold, silver, and bronze badges look a bit too unsaturated (washed out.)<br>
Could they be dialed up a bit?  e.g.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lXGT4.png"" alt=""Original badges"">  <sup><em>(original)</em></sup><br>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6dxW5.png"" alt=""Alternate badges with more saturation"">  <sup><em>(more saturation)</em></sup></p></li>
<li><p>The tag font ought to be more legible.  The weight seems too heavy for a small font, and the font color doesn't appear to be distinct enough from the background color.</p></li>
<li><p>In the question list, I noticed the date format is like <em>""06.28&nbsp;@&nbsp;15:29""</em>.  Could we keep the format <em>""jun&nbsp;28&nbsp;at&nbsp;15:29""</em> that we have now?  Converting the month abbreviation to a number leads to confusion especially when <code>dd &lt;= 12</code>. (Even Canadians and Americans can't agree on which comes first in a numeric date, the month or day.)</p></li>
<li><p>Could user name links be kept blue, or colored a bit more prominently? With the beta theme, at a glance it's easy to look at the home page and see who has been posting lately. With the proposed design, the user names tend to blend in with the surrounding date numbers and reputation number.</p></li>

<ol>
<li>I've experimented with different lockups for the logo and this one made the most sense visually. It may not necessarily represent the correct hierarchy of the two elements, but that would be asking it to achieve too much.</li>
<li>The piggy bank is used in a lot of cultures so I'm not worried about it translating internationally. The thinking behind the wider positioned bars is that they reference the original Stack Exchange symbol better and also work better in smaller representations, when tighter bars may render as just one big hole.</li>
<li>The 'Ask a Question' underline will be a lot crisper once the design is implemented so I think it may be enough to help it stand out. Finer tweaks like this are typically better suited for the implementation phase as you get to see exactly how everything looks in the browser, and not just a mockup.</li>
<li>It seems there's a consensus regarding the voting buttons. I like your suggestions and gravitate towards the 'no volatility' version as it still maintains the arrow convention.</li>
<li>Again, perhaps something better suited for the implementation phase. As a general idea, I didn't want the badges to be the very first thing that you notice, which you might given they're the only bright spots of color on an otherwise mostly monochromatic header.</li>
<li>It should be legible enough once coded. Photoshop is pretty bad at text rendering, especially in small sizes, but the text overall will be a lot crisper in the browser.</li>
<li>Good catch. The format should and will remain the same.</li>
<li>How important are these user names when browsing the list of questions? Should they be the second thing standing out after the question itself? In any case, the difference will be slightly more visible in the final implementation, again due to the quality of text rendering in the mockups.</li>

<p>Most of the time, even if you manage to indicate that you fixed what was wrong, they'll <em>still</em> want to take a look just to see what the actual issue was, and if there's anything else that might need their attention or perhaps editorial love.</p>

<p>With that said, we <em>ideally</em> funnel most of this through review queues, where expiring flags once action is taken and peer reviewed makes a whole lot more sense.

<p>Consequently, many existing questions tagged <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/charity"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;charity&#39;"" rel=""tag"">charity</a> would need to be re-tagged as <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/charitable-contributions"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;charitable-contributions&#39;"" rel=""tag"">charitable-contributions</a>.</p>

811,10589,,2,,3,796,,,1,,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>Yes, we should distinguish between the two.</p>

<p>Technically, to invest, one needs to make trades. That's ""trading"" in the sense of making trades, but that's not ""trading"" in the sense of active trading or day-trading. The <code>trading</code> tag should refer to the latter.</p>

<p>It's useful to use a different name when we're referring to these two different contexts -- which is the whole point here: we tag <code>trading</code> when we mean what the OP said: short-term, price-motivated trades. We tag <code>investing</code> when we mean what the OP said: long-term and ownership-oriented trades.</p>

<p>Trading can be investing with a very short time horizon, but often the goal has nothing to do with long-term potential, ownership, or any of the other common considerations of an investor. Similarly, investors might take some of the considerations of traders in mind when entering or exiting positions. In other words, there will be gray areas where the two overlap, but much more often there'll be black-and-white areas that are clearly just one of the two.</p>

812,3361,,2,,3,801,,,0,,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I am a late arrival. <strong>I love the design!</strong> It is perfect for our site, with the paper currency look to it! I had two suggestions though.</p>

<p>First, thank you for including the piggy bank. I like the shape and dimensions of piggy. He is perfect! The lines evocative of SE are fine, although maybe a little forced, but I can live with that. My request may not be feasible for that very reason, the resemblance to the SE logo. However, I would really find a pink shade piggy bank more traditional and natural than a grainy blue green piggy. This could easily be addressed in a variety of ways.</p>

<h2>Fine-tuned piggy</h2>

<ol>
<li>Make piggy pink, and leave him where he is. His pink color would be a variation of the pink color that is the background of MONEY on the far right. There would be sufficient contrast, as the background color on the far left is currently a darker blue green.</li>
<li>For a piggy on a pink background, flip the color band in the header, so that MONEY is on blue green instead of pink, and piggy is on pink. I'm not so certain about doing that!</li>
</ol>

<h2>Voting count typeface</h2>

<p>Is it possible to use a heavier version of the typeface for the up and down voting buttons? The number of votes seems difficult to read to me. The type face is not one I've seen before. Perhaps it is more common on Canadian or other money, which is fine. But could you make it a little heavier, for readability?</p>

<p>Overall, the new design looks great, and rather elegant.</p>

<h2>Thank you!</h2>

<p><strong>Praise</strong><br>
The voting buttons are better in the second version, by the way! The volatility arrow was a delightful thought, and I liked it so much, that you thought of that. But it was just too crowded given the size and color contrast.</p>

817,3,,1,,5,,77,1,4,,,"The ""security"" tag is ambiguous. Should we re-define it according to the general meaning?",<discussion><tags>,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I just noticed the <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/security"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;security&#39;"" rel=""tag"">security</a> tag has an ambiguous meaning.  I started to address this with some tag edits, and then realized I should post here about it so we can discuss &amp; document the decision, since I'm also proposing to change the current tag wiki definition.</p>

<p>Here's the problem:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>On the one hand, the tag wiki currently defines ""security"" in the sense of <strong>finance</strong>: <em>""A security (also known as a financial instrument) is a tradable asset of any kind. For questions related to a specific asset class, use a specific tag, e.g. ""stock"" or ""bond"".""</em>  There are/were a handful of questions that used the tag in this sense.</p></li>
<li><p>On the other hand, <strong>most</strong> of the questions that actually use the <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/security"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;security&#39;"" rel=""tag"">security</a> tag relate to the more <strong>general</strong> meaning, i.e. of being free from danger/threat or guarding against such. Questions using it in this sense talk about security tokens, online security, login credentials, identity theft, whether you can trust a company, etc.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I was thinking we would prefer that latter more general definition, since:</p>

<ol>
<li>It is the prevalent use here already, and</li>
<li>I can't see the finance-specific term ""security"" being of significant use around here since we've already got very specific tags for the kinds of securities individuals deal with: <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/stocks"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;stocks&#39;"" rel=""tag"">stocks</a>, <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/bonds"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;bonds&#39;"" rel=""tag"">bonds</a>, <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/options"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;options&#39;"" rel=""tag"">options</a>, <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mutual-funds"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;mutual-funds&#39;"" rel=""tag"">mutual-funds</a>, <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/certificate-of-deposit"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;certificate-of-deposit&#39;"" rel=""tag"">certificate-of-deposit</a>, etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>So:</p>

<p>Should the <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/security"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;security&#39;"" rel=""tag"">security</a> tag be re-defined to mean only the concept of security as in being free from danger/threat or guarding against such, e.g. as in ""computer security"".

<ol>
<li><p>I think the term ""security"" will come up in more searches for topics related to the general definition. We already have tags addressing topics that relate to ""all financial securities"", e.g. <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/investing"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;investing&#39;"" rel=""tag"">investing</a> and <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/trading"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;trading&#39;"" rel=""tag"">trading</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>This is a minor point, but the term ""security"" can be somewhat ambiguous, e.g. in <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/q/21068/7590"">these</a> <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/q/11010/7590"">questions</a>. As I said above, the general tags that cover topics that concern securities are more than adequate, in my opinion.</p></li>

1854,3361,-1,1,,2,,88,3,2,,,Questions whose legality is uncertain due to uncertain regulatory status,<discussion>,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I just noticed this Meta Money.SE post, <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/840/what-to-do-with-potentially-criminal-scenario-questions"">What to do with potentially criminal scenario questions?</a>  It was a good catch. The subject was Money.SE policy about inquiries with plausibly illegal intent. I realize that it is not easy to make rules about the general case; <strong>all the answers seemed reasonable to me</strong>.</p>

<p>The particular subject of the original question pertained to <strong><a href=""https://plus.google.com/+EllieK/posts/Bonp1fh7uHu"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">qualified investor status</a></strong> under Rule 506 of Regulation D and Rule 144A of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. The SEC recently changed certain rules about securities offerings in order to implement JOBS Act requirements. The Twitter IPO, most noticeably the initial ""confidential"" S-1 disclosure, is one example. Unless we are very certain, I suggest proceeding with care. That question was especially bad, because it was seeking to accomplish something that would be illegal prior to <strong>AND</strong> after the JOBS Act changes.</p>

<p>I would suggest that we act quickly when there is a question that would <strong>plausibly</strong> break a variety of U.S. laws e.g. SEC, Internal Revenue Service, Federal Trade Commission. Such inquiries are usually outside the scope of Money SE. With the JOBS Act, there will be new questions, as the new legislation introduces opportunities that were not possible under previous investor and general solicitation rules. We should welcome that, as it provides new opportunities for us, by increasing interest in Money.SE and thus increased site activity! However, <strong><a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/a/843/3361"">there was agreement</a></strong> (based on up vote count) that because we are not attorneys, we should not act decisively when there is a question whose legality is uncertain. That seems unwise. It <strong>is</strong> reasonable to inquire about the definition of qualified or accredited investor, though.</p>

<p>The intent of my post is to elicit discussion. I am not asking a question per se, thus my choice of the <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/discussion"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;discussion&#39;"" rel=""tag"">discussion</a> tag.</p>

<li>Call it wrong, and explain the intent and possible confusion </li>
<li>Ignore it because it is a bad question (aka Don't feed the trolls)</li>

</ol>

<p>All of those are strong, action oriented items that will have the effect of (I hope) making the Internet a better place.</p>

<p>Remember you are not an attorney (I don't think, I believe you work in finance).  I'm not at least.  So we can't really say what is and isn't illegal when it comes to some of these finer points.  But what we can say, <strong>as a community</strong>, what does and doesn't belong here.</p>

<p><em>(Please bear in mind I am speaking to the generality. although there was a specific question that sparked the discussion, it isn't germane to the topic of site rules going forward.)</em></p>

A rude or defensive response is less likely to illicit help from me because I don't think they are willing to <em>join</em> us so much as use us.

<p>Consider that the majority of the world still lives without running water.  Consider that the Chinese who make your iPhones work for $1/hour.  Consider that FoxConn (Apple in China) had to install safety nets around their facility to catch suicide jumpers who hated their lives.  </p>

<p>I love to teach.  I don't care how stupid or off topic the question.  I don't know why so many people on these sites are the exact opposite.  Condense duplicate questions,  but closing marginally 'off-topic' questions?  Give me a break.  Just let me add a tag to the question, please.</p>

<p>So questions that don't serve the goal get closed.</p>

<p>While I apologize that this site didn't answer your question, the community here has made a decision about what it wants to be about.  StackExchange is community powered (as you know) and the decisions are made by, and for, the community.</p>

<p><strong>You got very specific answers in your post why your question was closed:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Your question was academic</li>
<li>Your question was about economics, which the community doesn't want to address</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>To answer your question here:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>The community has time and time again voted in meta to stay focused on personal finance.  Business/Small Business was shot down as a topic.  Economics was shot down as a topic.  We once expanded to cover consumer protection issues like scams and ripoffs.</li>
<li>The community wants what it wants.</li>
</ol>

<p>You are welcome to ask again, at any time, to expand the scope of the site and let the community vote.  We recently had discussion to clarify our position on small business and personal finance after OnStartUps.SE closed.  I would say we are very open to change here.</p>

<p>However if you do wish to open a topic, I would suggest:</p>

<ol>
<li>A much less aggressive tone.  Another point of pride in our community is a maintenance of civility and inclusiveness.</li>
<li>Play by our rules for a while.  Earn some rep where you can and prove you want to be here.  Anyone can tell you are passionate and articulate; a perfect fit for any SE site.</li>
<li>Participate in meta with constructive criticism.  Consider running for mod in time.  You are clearly off to a strong start there and there is extra influence with such a position.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>However...</strong>
declaring shame upon us for not meeting your personal whim? Accusing us of ""greed"" for not serving <em>your personal needs</em>?  Questioning the motives or purpose of the community because you don't like how the community chooses to operate?  <strong>If you want a break, <em>by all means</em>, have a break.</strong></p>

<p>That all being said, I would still encourage you to participate (and abide the community) here.  If you feel the need for an economics stackexchange, visit Area51, propose and gather support.  Use your passion to build, not criticize.</p>

1876,1113,1113,2,,11,1873,,,1,,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>On any stackexchange site, it’s important to have most questions answered. If questions are not answered, it would be a Ghost town with lots of questions and no answers. The first thing a new user who comes via internet would see that there is a similar question he is interested in, but no answer ... over a period of time he would start ignoring the site as he would believe there are only questions here but no answers ... that's one of the problems with Yahoo Q&amp;A free for all topic, just filter ... but no answers ...</p>

<p>Or a user comes in looking for specific answer via internet only to find academic answers... are again put off.</p>

<p>On this site, time and again we have felt that we cannot answer economic questions as we collectively do not have that skill. We may answer some, but a vast majority we cannot. Hence rather than choose to keep questions on economics that we can answer and close others, we have applied a consistent yard stick.</p>

<p>There was a stackexchange site on economics, however it did not make it to a full site and got closed down. Maybe there is some other place better on the internet for economics, I don't know as that is not my area of interest, maybe people read blogs or books for economics stuff ....</p>

<p>If labeling were to solve the problem, we could have one big stackexchange site and let labels do the segregation ... why have so many site at first place ... just like Yahoo Q&amp;A or tons other ... way during initial days of stackoverflow, it was felt that creating separate sites sets the user expectation. So I know if I have a photography question it would get answered on photography.se, if I have a travel, it would be travel.se. </p>

<p>However if I have a legal question or question on ""Coin Collection"" hobby or on ""Technology Business Analyst"" or ""Banking Domain"" questions, sorry there is no Stackexchange site. I would have to look elsewhere, but on topics that are part of SE network, I have a guarantee that I will get an answer in less than 10 mins on any fully graduated site. I am no Microsoft Excel, however there are tons of times; I have committed my deadline because I know if I put the right question on Superuser, I will get an answer in no time.</p>

<p>Am I disappointed that there is no site for “Business Analyst”. Yes I AM. I tried creating one, couldn’t get support. It doesn’t mean I would barge into programmers.se and ask them to label and allow my question, as logically without understanding requirements there is no programming :). However there are some requirements around 200+ out of 28,000+ on programmers.se. So yes the site allows some requirement question, and not everything under ""Business Analyst"". </p>

<p>Like wise on money.se, we do allow few economics questions that we feel are related to personal finance; around 76+ out of 6000+ and not everything under ""economics""</p>

<p><strong>Why is <code>money.stackexchange.com</code> only personal finance, especially when there's no better SE for other money-related questions?</strong><br />
Ans: It’s because we choose to focus on personal finance. It is irrelevant if there are no better or worse site on other topics on SE or elsewhere. The goal of SE is not to corner every possible space in Internet. Joel has said this time &amp; again.</p>
<p><strong>Is growing the community even a goal?</strong><br />
Ans: That is definitely one of the secondary / incidental objectives; it has to be balanced with other goals.</p>
<p><strong>Are you trying to help everyone, or just yourselves?</strong><br />
Ans: We are trying to help people with personal finance questions to the best of our abilities. We still have 100+ questions for which we don’t know the answers.</p>
<h1>Does anyone think that you're doing more overall good by staying exclusive (to personal finance)?</h1>
<p>Ans: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>The fact that there's not an appropriate place for my question is a failure of the system.</strong><br />
Ans: You are entitled to your opinion. SE did not make any promise to you that there will be a place for all your questions. Try Yahoo Q&amp;A or tons of other Q &amp; A that are better systems to solve all your Q &amp; A.</p>
<h2>And my last plea; <em>this is my question that sparked this whole outrage;</em></h2>
<p>Ans: Yep great question. Forget the “<strong>our economy is on the brink of collapse</strong>”
The imminent war between India &amp; Pakistan over nuclear stuff and North Korea not falling in line, and the recent escalation of China over the islands, the unrest in Egypt and Israel are very important question that can destroy the world … so its not just &quot;<strong>economy</strong>&quot; but “<strong>our whole world is on the brink of collapse</strong>”<br />
But nope, we can’t answer these questions.</p>

<li><p>How many users did not turn after posting a question and waiting for answer. This is something I observed with few questions, we answered late, I think in few hours, but the user waited only an hour and then never came back. Indicates he found answer somewhere and went away.

<p>Now, the caveats:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>9999999 is a screwball, it just means a question that was posted about a year ago got an answer that week (due to a quirk in the query), or wasn't answered at all.</p></li>
<li><p>Likewise, some of your higher weeks also include a question that was getting kind of dusty finally getting an answer.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If you drop the highest 5 or 10% as flukes, the numbers start looking pretty decent. On average, <em>a lot</em> of questions see an answer in the first 60 - 120 minutes, which is pretty good. </p>

<p>Re-tooling of the internal stats gadget which moderators can access will provide this data more conveniently to <em>them</em>, which they can in turn share pieces of as needed, for instance if things are going really well, or really slipping.</p>

<p>But, all in all, you do a pretty good job of fulfilling the promise that our UI infers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Questions get answered relatively soon</li>

<p><strong>Suggestions on How to Tag Time Sensitive Questions</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Only use years in the tags</li>
<li>Tag at least the last year the answer applies</li>
<li>If you can, tag the first year the answer applies</li>
<li>If you are answering a question that is time sensitive, edit the question with the correct tags</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Reviewing Questions That Are Time Sensitive</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Don't rely on the tags to spell out time sensitive info.  Clarify in the body of the answer.  (Maybe in the question too)</li>
<li>If you find an Q/A that is out of date, earn free points and ask it again for the new year</li>
<li>If you find an time sensitive Q/A that is of no historical value, vote to close as no longer relevant.  We don't want to lead people astray, but we don't want to live exclusively in the present.</li>
</ul>

<p>For questions that span multiple years, do the last year the answer applies if you can only tag one, do the start and end year if you can tag twice.  I am saying this because having tags that span years could get out of control.  I am, however, unsure of this stance and could be persuaded to change.</p>

<p>I see value in answers that are clear about the applicable date, even if that date is historical.  While they might be periodically edited to link to a new, updated answer, I don't know why they would need to be deleted as a matter of practice. There is value in having accurate historical information.  </p>

<p>I can also see a certain amount of damage by people who don't read, but that has to be judged on a case by case basis.  Certainly tax rules from the United States that expired in 1980 don't help a ton, but tax rules from 2011 could help a person trying to catch up and not make mistakes.</p>

<p>I cannot speak to the specific nature of international tax rules, but from what I read here I gather they mostly work in that same way.</p>

<p>I imagine a scenario where two co-workers are debating some tax rule by some law, and they search on the Internet for the answer.</p>

<p>In general, questions that are aging into no value are off-topic on StakExchange. So the question <strong>""What it this year's IRA maximum""</strong> should be changed into <strong>""Where to find the yearly maximums of IRA""</strong>, whose answer can contain the maximum for couple last years and can be updated yearly. Similarly, in the ""girlfriend"" question, there's no need for the time-dependent tag -- the information that the claimable amount changes every year is enough, nevertheless it would be nice to have a link to an official resource that contains this information.</p>

<p>So maybe a good addition to the tags would be something like <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/values-changing-yearly"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;values-changing-yearly&#39;"" rel=""tag"">values-changing-yearly</a> (that's a bad one, but I'm neither native speaker nor sufficiently creative to think out a better one).</p>

<p>I don't think that precludes discussion of certain advanced strategies that individual investors may be capable of implementing. Yet, I do think an answer shouldn't assume that an OP has the requisite knowledge, comfort level, or risk tolerance for what's proposed.

<li><p><em>Comments</em> on a question can be used to elicit more information from the OP about the knowledge and comfort level,  if it isn't evident in the question, profile, or other questions from the OP.</p></li>
<li><p>Answers describing advanced strategies should mention, up front, that what's about to be suggested is an advanced strategy or complex product and might not be suitable for investors without the requisite knowledge or risk appetite.

My thoughts were that no individual would try to get a seat on the NYSE for personal finance reasons. They'd do this if their job was stock trading. As such, I thought this question was similar to me asking, ""Is it worthwhile for me to attend a Rails bootcamp to increase my knowledge of Rails, as I am a professional software developer.""</p>

<p>I want to be very clear, though. I may be mistaken. It could be that people routinely buy seats on the NYSE for personal finance. Or perhaps not regularly people, but people with a net worth of, say, $2 million. If that's the case, I would say we should probably not have closed the question, and I was mistaken. On the other hand, if this is only a reasonable thing to do if you have, say, $50 million, I'd say it's outside the realm.</p>

<p>Now, the question is actually asking <em>whether it is worthwhile</em>. If the answer is actually complex ('no generally, but yes if you have more than x to invest, and make more than y transactions per day'), it shouldn't have been closed.</p>

<p>In any case, I generally enjoy Kaushik's questions and learn from them. I think it is clear that we are discussing whether this particular question is appropriate for our scope, and nobody's trying to discourage Kaushik's contributions.</p>

1898,2998,,2,,0,1892,,,0,,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>Generally, when a question is about an advanced issue - I'd expect the OP to be sophisticated enough to find the answer through research, and not through passively querying a Q&amp;A forum.</p>

<p>Essentially, advanced questions should come in the form ""I researched this, read that, and cannot understand this point - please help"".</p>

<p>Specifically to the question, which I voted to close as off-topic - I'd expect a person considering purchasing a seat on an exchange be fully capable of providing at least a basic list of pro/con considerations, and how they apply to him. The specific question clearly shows that the OP doesn't even know what having a seat even means, let alone be able to decide or even consider if it is to his benefit to own one.</p>

<p>I'm sure that the last sentence of the question (essentially a question ""what does owning a seat mean?"") would have merit on its own on this forum. But when added to a larger question ""Whether I should have one?"" it only shows that the OP is, well, clueless. And answering such a question will not provide any meaningful benefit neither to the OP nor the others.</p>

<p>I also downvoted the question, as I downvote many questions of that specific OP, since it is evident that he applied zero effort to understanding the issue on his own. Many of his questions (not all though, but many) look as if he thought of something - and immediately ran to the forum to ask about it, without any effort whatsoever to understand what he's asking and trying to find an answer (for many of the questions - that would be a simple Google query).</p>

I think your reputation score of almost 3k (on a site where most questions and answers do not get too many votes) shows that more people value your contributions.</p>

<p>That being said, I have a PhD in mathematics (although nothing related to finance), so this is likely not the typical background of the average user here. To fully appreciate many of your answers one needs to have a fairly good understanding of how the markets work, and how things like discounting and compounding work. I agree that this is basic mathematics that most people likely have learnt in school, but unfortunately experience shows that for many people this causes trouble. Sometimes this is due to an unfounded fear of mathematics, thinking ""mathematics is hard"", and giving up even before trying. However, without this background people may not understand your answers, and therefore falsely conclude that you did not answer the question.</p>

<p>Now, is this a problem? I think not, the stackexchange format accomodates this, since every user can upvote the answers they find most helpful, or ask for clarifications in the comments.

<li><p>Don't assume the OP is the <em>only</em> intended audience for any answer you write. These questions and answers are intended to be long-lived knowledge resources indexed by search engines. A good question page will be viewed by many <strong>thousands</strong> of visitors. Aim to be understood by <em>this</em> audience, and help <em>them</em>. Consider the OP's question a ""case-in-point"" opportunity to generalize and/or elaborate &ndash; though without writing a book and without straying too far. Links help, but don't liberally pepper an answer with links without somehow tying things together.</p></li>
<li><p>If an OP's question is potentially ambiguous with one narrow interpretation, but another more likely interpretation, perhaps arising from incorrect use of terminology or else a common misconception, please don't <em>only</em> address that narrow interpretation to the exclusion of the more common one.</p>

<p>If there's another possible interpretation, try to at least mention it in your answer, even if you aren't going to address that part. You can be terse, but don't obscure by omission. Refer back to point #1.</p>

<p>Be aware: in <strong>many</strong> cases, an OP never returns to clarify the original question. It's often up to the community to improve &amp; clarify a question in order for it to be a lasting resource. <em>As time passes, this concern becomes paramount!</em> If the question simply cannot be improved to make it a useful question, it should be closed (and eventually deleted).</p></li>
<li><p>Don't fight the community on every question closure. Yes, sometimes an OP deserves a defense and a case might be made, a question perhaps modified to be on-topic once rationale is discovered, but many times a guideline has already been established. Not every guideline the community has already worked to establish should be revisited and questioned every time a new question arises that contravenes the guideline. Just because you may be knowledgeable, able, willing, and interested in answering a question doesn't make it on-topic here.</p></li>
<li><p>The world is bigger than the United States. I'm not sure where you're located, but from many of your answers you appear to have an affinity for quoting in great detail specific U.S. rules and regulations, perhaps because that is where you trade. While a very U.S-specific answer may not be technically incorrect when a question is in an ambiguous state, a later clarification about the OP's location may render your answer incorrect.</p>

<p>Where location may be a significant factor, encourage the OP to disclose the location, or look at their profile for the information (or other questions that provide the clue) and tag accordingly. Alternatively, if you prefer rep whoring with quick answers instead of first seeking clarification, then try to write your answer for the general case, e.g. as in what you understand major jurisdictions <em>typically</em> do, while, say, citing the U.S. as an example with the caveat that ""it depends.""</p></li>
<li><p>If you're suggesting an advanced and/or risky strategy, label it as such. Provide appropriate caveats. Even if the OP seems to know what they're talking about, remember the audience for this site: people who want to be financially literate. They aren't necessarily there yet.</p>

<p>Most users will be practicing personal finance using typical tools (consumer software, bank accounts, mutual fund accounts, discount brokerage accounts, etc.) and securities typically accessible to retail investors. Layering on information about tools, services, securities, or strategies likely only accessible to professional traders or accredited investors is seldom helpful unless the other bases have been covered as well.</p>

<p>There may be highly-educated investors, traders, software developers, physicists, and mathematicians frequenting this site and voting on answers, but please see point #1 again. Many of us voting here aren't looking to judge how smart you are, but how <em>helpful</em> your answers are. The core audience tends not to vote or comment. The typical <strong>reader</strong> of a question here is an anonymous visitor landing on a question page via search results. They have zero voting/commenting privileges. We fight for these users.</p></li>
<li><p>You've been here three months. Yet, the site and many of its frequently-posting, commenting, and voting experts have been around for one, two, three, four years. Respect and consider what other expert users are suggesting when they provide constructive criticism on an answer. You might win the same consideration for your comments when it's evident you're taking comments of the other experts seriously.</p>

<p>Try not to look at every critical comment as a challenge to be answered with a lengthy debate. We're not interested in a long string of ""but ..., but ..., but..."" and capitulating in exasperation. We'd rather you improve your answer. We try <strong>really hard</strong> to encourage you to improve your own answer. If we give up, we'll either improve it for you, or down-vote it to oblivion and delete it.</p></li>

However, it's been suggested that <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/28580/do-i-owe-us-excise-taxes-on-revenue-coming-from-abroad"">this question</a> about excise taxes is off-topic, although it seems clear to me from the question that the asker is an performing independent services as an individual for some third-party.</p>

<p>Is this on-topic or not?</p>

<p>My own feeling is that virtually anything related to the internal workings of a business consisting of one person should be considered on-topic (and probably the same for businesses consisting of, say, a husband and wife).  I say ""consisting of one person"" rather than ""sole proprietorship"" because I really mean businesses where it's just one person doing everything (or at least, questions that would apply in that situation).  If your business is just you, everything you do with your business is your personal finance, because who else's finance could it be?  Even if there are administrative differences between you and the business, ultimately all decisions are made by you and involve only you.</p>

<p>It's true that there are administrative peculiarities to managing your personal finance when you have a business, but I don't see how that makes this intrinsically ""not personal finance"" any more than the administrative peculiarities of collecting Social Security, making use of tax-deferred investment accounts, or handling a deceased relative's estate, all of which seem to be uncontroversially on-topic.</p>

<p>Here's what I suggested, and the mods agreed, to keep off-topic:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Basically anything else that might have been on topic on OnStartups
  but doesn't directly relate to personal finance/money. That includes
  immigration, legal, financing, accounting etc questions <em>that do not
  directly relate to personal finance.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Re the excise taxes - you can make the same claim about everything. There's always a person involved somewhere, it doesn't make it <em>personal</em>.</p>

<p>Excise taxes are purely business, and do not affect individual finances. They affect business finances. The fact that the business is in this case a sole proprietorship - is incidental and has <strong>no bearing</strong> on the actual question. It could have been a multimillion corporation, and the question (and the answer!) would remain exactly the same.  </p>

<p>From the <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">on-topic FAQ</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Sole Proprietorships</strong></p>
  
  <p>Bookkeeping</p>
  
  <p><em>Taxes as they pertain to an individual's return</em></p>
  
  <p>When to incorporate to protect your work or assets</p>

1914,91,91,2,,3,1910,,,7,,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I vote the tax question concerned is on-topic on the basis the asker more than the question itself.</p>

<p>I took the ideas we incorporated into the topic guide to be related to the size of the business, and the size was what made it go out of bounds.  If a sole proprietorship owes taxes, then a person owes taxes.  We aren't talking about a single person who incorporated, we are talking about a freelancer.</p>

<p>[littleadv wrote:]</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If we answer the question about the excise tax of a sole proprietor -
  why not answer the exact same question (and with the exact same
  answer) for a corporation? If he was asking how to deduct the excise
  tax on his schedule C - I'd answer it gladly. But to the question
  asked - being him a sole proprietor has no bearing whatsoever. Just
  because he's a business of one person doesn't make the business
  personal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my opinion the size of the business can the deciding factor in fudging a rule a little bit.  I absolutely see the point about it being the same answer regardless of the size of the business, but I think we should cater to people asking questions not to the letter of the rules.  </p>

<p>I think the point littleadv is making is to avoid the hypocrisy in answering an excise tax question for a solo operation but not for a large business.  But we draw similar emotional boundaries for other circumstances.  If a poster asks about filing a 1099 but it is homework, we won't answer. However if it is a real problem it gets answered.  The <em>intent</em> is why we answer.</p>

<p>The community has been closing a lot of questions lately and that is healthy; the community is deciding the its own boundaries without mods enforcing rules.  </p>

<p><strong>However as we gain momentum in closing votes I want to be the devil's advocate for being more inclusive to grow a large, robust and diverse community.</strong></p>

<h1><strong>BIG EDIT</strong></h1>

<p>However, if the question is a marginal one that doesn't get an answer, perhaps the best course is to close and delete it anyway.  The issue of a question being on-topic is less  relevant if the question gets no answers.</p>

<p>The remaining discussion is to the speed with which something gets removed, but that isn't what is being asked here:</p>

<h1>Summary:</h1>

<ul>
<li>Sole proprietors &amp; their finances:  on topic</li>
<li>Corporate taxes, even for sole proprietors:  might be, they have to be judged one by one</li>
</ul>

<p>Regardless, the site shouldn't have straggler questions so these questionable ones should be cleaned up and removed <em>a little</em> earlier than normal un-answered questions which are clearly on-topic.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think your last sentence sums it up. If the question relates to how
  the business [affects] your personal finances the question is valid. If
  it does not affect your personal finances then it is off-topic. – 
  brainimus Aug 5 '10 at 1:10</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>But</strong>, ""affects"" and ""relates"" in that statement both need to be interpreted as more proximate to the finances/income, and not a meandering indirect connection from A to B to C to D, thereby including everything under the sun.</p>

<p>I think we need to ask of any small business question: Does it relate <em>directly</em> to affecting the income earned by the single owner/operator/employee, and without being too specific as to the <em>kind</em> of business being run?</p>

<p>For instance, a sole proprietor that sells cheese should not be asking questions about the cheese business, or how to price his cheese, or negotiating costs with suppliers, or about advertising, or about office supplies. While these subjects all could relate somehow and eventually back to income, they aren't close enough to it.</p>

<p>So, no, I don't agree with your suggestion that <strong>all</strong> single owner/operator/employee small business questions should be on-topic just because it's one individual and therefore <em>personal</em>.</p>

<p>That word ""personal"" that I included in the site name ""Personal Finance &amp; Money"" isn't intended to stand alone as a catch-all &mdash; it is married to the word ""finance"" and <em>not</em> the word ""business"" (or anything else). A question has to be about the finances/money/income parts of such a small business, not any other part of it related back to income by six degrees of separation.</p>

<p>So, IMHO, that <em>does</em> include as on-topic any question about the taxes a business might pay, and whether the business structure is a sole proprietorship, LLC, or corporation &mdash; <strong>as long as there is only a single owner that is the sole employee.</strong> Should your question about the state excise tax be on-topic? I think so, as long as that is a tax that a single owner/operator would face in your state and you're in that boat.</p>

<p>And to take this just a little further, I don't think we should, say, permit LLC/sole-prop questions while disallowing corporation questions, simply because one falls on the personal tax return while the paperwork for the other might be filed separately.</p>

<p>As a contractor operating as a [Canadian] corporation, I file a corporate tax return, and corporate taxes reduce my personal net income and worth as effectively as the personal income taxes do. My accountant, in fact, handles both of my returns, and in his words the tax planning for individuals who own their own small business corporation should be <strong>integrated.</strong></p>

<p>So, the chosen legal structure of the business should not be a reason to discriminate. The criteria should be: is the question proximately related to income, and is the business owned &amp; operated by a single individual?</p>

<p>Spouses, perhaps, might be a reasonable inclusion, but I'll leave that an open question. But certainly: if a business has any other staff, or any other owners, then a question about it crosses into the off-topic territory.</p>

<h3>What are Community Promotion Ads?</h3>

<p>Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.</p>

<h3>Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?</h3>

<p>This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:</p>

<ul>
<li>the site's twitter account</li>
<li>financial blogs and websites</li>
<li>cool events or conferences</li>
<li>anything else your community would genuinely be interested in</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal is for future visitors to find out about <em>the stuff your community deems important</em>. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are <em>relevant to your own community's interests</em>, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. </p>

<h3>Why do we reset the ads every year?</h3>

<p>Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.</p>

<p>The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>

<p>The answers you post to this question <em>must</em> conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>All answers should be in the exact form of:</p>

<pre><code>[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]

</code></pre>

<p>Please <strong>do not add anything else to the body of the post</strong>. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.</p></li>
<li><p>The question must always be tagged with the magic <a href=""/questions/tagged/community-ads"" class=""post-tag moderator-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;community-ads&#39;"" rel=""tag"">community-ads</a> tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Image requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li>The image that you create must be <strong>220 x 250 pixels</strong></li>
<li>Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)</li>
<li>Must be GIF or PNG</li>
<li>No animated GIFs</li>
<li>Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB</li>
</ul>

<h3>Score Threshold</h3>

<p>There is a <strong>minimum score threshold</strong> an answer must meet (currently <strong>6</strong>) before it will be shown on the main site.</p>

<p>You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/1918"">here</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>3. I suggest making the <strong>""Ask Question""</strong> link more prominent. I see the underline on close inspection, but even so, the link doesn't stand out
  as much as it ought to, perhaps owing to the all-caps used for all the
  links on that line. Maybe lighten the other links, or darken this one?
  Or something else to help it stand out more. It stands out well enough
  in the beta theme we have now because the font weight is obviously
  heavier.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What's worse: In the original design proposal, the links were <em>under</em> the logo, and centered. Now, they are positioned on the same line as the logo, more to the right. This means that ""Ask Question"" is also likely to be <strong>hidden</strong> if the user doesn't have their browser window sized wide enough.  (Stack Overflow also has this issue, but at least the ""Ask Question"" link there is set aside far enough to the right that it stands out when the window <em>is</em> wide enough.)</p>

1933,11604,-1,2,,4,1921,,,1,,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I found a post from a few years ago with someone asking for the same thing on <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/53539/notify-on-deletion-of-replied-to-comment"">Stackoverflow Meta</a>, as well as <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/53530/deleting-comments-which-are-replied-to-should-not-be-so-easy"">a related suggestion</a> that replied-to comments be undeletable without consent from the repliers.</p>

<p>This discussion on those questions points out some significant problems with this.  There are two that I think are most germane.  First, it's not possible with the way comment notifications are implemented (or at least how they were implemented in 2010).  Second, if a person has more than one comment, you can't tell which one a replier was replying to, since @-somebody replies to the person, not the comment.  You can see some other stuff in the discussion, and if you search SO Meta you can find a few other questions that touch on similar issues.</p>

<p>My feeling is that the actual benefit of this feature would be rather small.  The only real gain is that people can sometimes avoid ""looking silly"" because of a dangling comment, even though it would only ever look silly to people who aren't familiar enough with the system to realize that a previous comment was deleted, and even though it still wouldn't avoid silly-looking dangling comments that neglected to use @-notification to mark which comment they were replying to.  On the flip side, it has the potential to result in a fair number of distracting notifications due to comment deletions on old threads that the replier doesn't care about cleaning up.</p>

<p>I'd just like to reiterate what I said in my comments: comments and notifications are not a Money SE, issue, they are a StackExchange-wide issue, so I think any solution should be considered with regard to how it would work across all StackExchange sites.  Likewise, from a practical standpoint, I'm skeptical that this is going to get much traction if users on the high-traffic SE sites like StackOverflow don't see it as a major problem.</p>

Post answers to this question containing any questions you would like to ask the candidates. Please only post <em>one question per answer</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>We, the Community Team, will be providing a small selection of generic questions. The first two will be guaranteed to be included, the latter ones are if the community doesn't supply enough questions. This will be done in a single post, unlike the prior instruction.</p></li>
<li><p>This is a perfect opportunity to voice questions that are specific to your community and issues that you are running into at current.</p></li>
<li><p>At the end of the phase, the Community Team will select <strong>up to 8 of the top voted questions submitted by the community</strong> provided in this thread, to use in addition to the aforementioned 2 guaranteed questions. We reserve some editorial control in the selection of the questions and may opt not to select a question that is tangential or irrelevant to moderation or the election. That said, if I have concerns about any questions in this fashion, I will be sure to point this out in comments before the decision making time.</p></li>
<li><p>Once questions have been selected, a new question will be opened to host the actual questionnaire for the candidates, containing 10 questions in total.</p></li>
<li><p>This is not the only option that users have for gathering information on candidates. As a community, you are still free to, for example, hold a live chat session with your candidates to ask further questions, or perhaps clarifications from what is provided in the Q&amp;A.</p></li>

<p>I've already been vocal about offering up a discussion of how the board works. We have an FAQ that offers what's on-topic and what isn't. It's not a discussion board, and the comments are allowed, but with an eye toward helping to firm up the answer, not to start a debate. In cases where there are differences of opinion (e.g. the 'cash-only' vs 'use cards for all purchases') I'd encourage the members to offer a well reasoned answer that supports their view. </p>

<p>I think the On-Topic has room to adjust a bit based on member demand. The fact that the economics board closed leaves a void for a category of question that might fit the general interest at Money.SE. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Being <em>welcoming</em> is key.  I personally am an introvert by nature and I take that perspective when I find a new user.  Regardless if their fear is real or not, I treat them as if it is.  This approach makes me give them 1.) a welcome, then 2.) the issue, and most importantly 3.) how they can fix the problem.  I will even occasionally offer a specific example they can emulate. If needed explicitly state my comments are not intended to be dismissive or condescending.</p>

<p>I hope as the site grows, I will no longer have time to do that.  I hope we are so busy that welcoming new users cannot be done when compared to the other tasks a mod does like spam removal and such.  My <em>plan</em> that my warm introductions and gentle handling of mistakes will be paid forward so the community has a habit of showing new users the way.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Often people are be both smart and <em>passionate</em>.  Aside from the occasional troll, I will tend towards encouraging the passion and simply removing the parts that generate the flags.  There isn't any point in admonishing a passionate user for the occasional outburst, especially when the outburst is clearly a work of their love and dedication.</p>

<p>However, if somebody is being a creepy jerk, I have no problem asking them politely to stop.  I will not make an assumption about what motivates a person, so if I have to bring up a behaviour problem I will point out the problem as I see it; suggest a remedy and leave the issue open for dialog.  Honest people who let their fire get the better of them always see the way, and trolls get bored and leave.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the issue is about being on/off topic; I would post in meta about the issue to let the community have a say.  If the mod is acting rashly or unfairly, the conversation is more direct.  Like any confrontational communication.  Don't assume, listen, don't accuse and find a middle ground.  It rarely fails.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>If members of the community ask for changes to the allowed topics for the site; what should be the process for change be? How would you decide to change the Money.SE help center based on the outcomes of meta.money discussions?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Changes to the community direction are always to be handled in meta.  I would first encourage the member to post their issue and make their case.  Then it is simply my job as the long term community member to explain <strong>why</strong> the topics are as they are.  If the change is something I agree with, I say so and let my answer be voted on.  After some time it will be easy to see if there is a passion in the community for change or not.  As is so often the case, the community moves and changes slowly, and that is usually the right thing to do.</p>

<p>It is also important in these discussions for a mod to point out the blue diamond doesn't give my vote on community direction anymore weight than a new member.  Perhaps my reputation does, but not the diamond.</p>

<p>If the change requires an update to the help, the discussion should continue in the meta post until the changes are done and agreed upon.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>If the community likes it, perhaps the question should be on topic.  Post it to meta.  Like any change we should talk about why, look for previous discussion and other citations, and finally see if the situation in the world is different than before.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>How will you contribute to a strong culture that welcomes new users and rewards good behavior from established users?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only tool I possess as a mod is the ability to delete bile as soon as I find it.  I must lead by example with positive culture, and remove unhelpful culture as I find it.  This is a community that will tend towards an adult demographic, and adults will behave like adults when treated as such.</p>

<p>As a mod, the blue diamond carries weight and influence.  I won't temper my comments about being kind and nice.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>How will you address the community if your feelings about the direction of the site are in conflict with the community's agreed upon direction as decided in meta.money?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The will of the community comes first.  The mod is in a powerful spot; my close vote is binding.  My delete vote is binding.  Therefore I have to use those tools as sparingly as possible.  I usually save my vote to close until I am the last vote.  If the community has a clear path then it is the job of the moderator to keep that direction, regardless of my personal feelings.  (That doesn't stop me from having a voice in meta to aim our community however.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>What role does community history have in guiding the future of the community?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The wheels of democracy should move slowly; change should be hard and and carefully considered.  I don't want the community to stagnate and not grow in new directions, but changes must be done slowly enough that we can all agree and adjust accordingly.  The worst change in the world is one where we have to revert later.  To that end; my reputation and days visited is a more important metric than being a mod.  My real job as a mod is to listen to the community and solicit information from the most experienced and respected users.  Mods encourage dialog while high rep users steer it. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>How will you react when a user lashes out at you, accusing you of being a {bully|idiot|a poor excuse for a human being} after you {close a question|delete an answer|delete a comment}?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I will post in the mod chat room and ask for quorum from the other mods. (If I haven't already brought my action to light.)  At that point, whatever the other site mods say will be the decision.  If my action is upheld, then the matter is over.  If I am overruled, I should consider taking the step to publicly admit a mistake and apologize.   Even if the angry user never sees the apology, the community should know that mods are not above the rules.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>In your opinion, what do moderators do?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li><p><em>Moderators are garbage people</em>:  we patrol the site looking to remove unnecessary content like ""thanks"" comments and spam posts.  We remove spam users and generally keep that home page clean and on topic.  Handling flags that the community ID's as a problem as quickly as possible.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Moderators encourage positive dialog</em>:  welcome new users, stick up for questions suffering from negative votes and making sure comments and content is constructive and polite.  If I can save a poor question or help a new users write a great question, I have done more good than any answer with a hundred votes.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Remember my place</em>:  being a mod doesn't make me smart.  I can't add answers anymore often than I normally would.  I don't change or remove content I disagree with.  I serve the community; I don't run it.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Be ready to explain things</em>:  users get to vote and move on.  Cast a flag and move on.  Mods should be ready to explain the reason for the change so no change is made in haste.  If a new user or high rep veteran questions my actions, if I can't back it up I might have made a mistake.</p></li>

1958,3,-1,2,,17,1949,,,1,,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<h2>Historical context</h2>
<p>I chose and proposed the name <em>Personal Finance &amp; Money</em> in my <a href=""http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/1721?phase=definition"">original Area 51 definition</a> for this site for one simple reason: the name we had under the Stack Exchange &quot;1.0&quot; model, prior to the <a href=""http://blog.stackexchange.com/post/518474918/stack-exchange-2-0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">&quot;2.0&quot; changes</a>, was <strong><a href=""http://basicallymoney.com"">Basically <em>Money</em></a></strong>. Keeping &quot;Money&quot; was a tip of the hat, continuity, w.r.t. the site's original brand.</p>
<p>While I'm talking about the original name, the &quot;Basically&quot; part was meant to indicate the site's general goal to help people be <em>financially literate</em>, being the <em>basics</em> needed to manage one's own finances and investments—i.e. not a site for quants or pro traders (&quot;it is my day job&quot;) type questions, not for corporate finance (beyond what retail investors would want to know for investing, or self-employed individuals operating as a corp), not for academia. But those restrictions were never spelled out. Early on, I cared more about getting questions and building a community, and less about corralling the topics.</p>
<p>Then, having to later go through the Area 51 site definition process under the evolved SE 2.0 model <strong>forced</strong> me to think more about what the site should <em>really</em> be about, and I decided the laser focus and root name needed to reflect <em>personal finance</em> (including what I think of as household &amp; family finance) as the umbrella over other topics. I didn't want the proposal to fail for lack of clarity on this! The original site was loose (e.g. economics was never explicitly off-topic) because I didn't have to gain community support for launching—I <em>owned</em> it. But for SE 2.0, I had to convince people to support the concept, so there needed to be a firm-enough concept to support.</p>
<p>But at the same time, I also wanted the &quot;&amp; Money&quot; in the name, following &quot;Personal Finance&quot;, to help transition the existing brand and community into the new SE 2.0 world. <em>&quot;Basically Money? Yeah, that site has become the new [Personal Finance &amp;] Money site under stackexchange.com.&quot;</em>  That was my thinking.</p>
<p>So &quot;Money&quot; is baggage, from the past. Baggage is all. By itself, it is a vestige, not intended to be defining. <a href=""http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/1721?phase=definition"">This definition</a> plus community-driven <em>meta</em> evolution since are what define us.</p>
<h2>Back to the present</h2>
<p>IMHO, we'll always have the &quot;money&quot; in our URL <code>money.stackexchange.com</code>. I don't see any reasonable way of replacing that without upsetting a lot. And even if it could be done, I <em>like</em> the mnemonic. (Consider how <a href=""http://diy.stackexchange.com""><em>Home Improvement</em></a> has the URL <code>diy.stackexchange.com</code>.)</p>
<p>Yet, three years later, if taking the word &quot;Money&quot; out of the full English site name, and the logo, would alleviate some confusion and sharpen the focus that had been intended, then I'm in favour of doing that. But please keep the main URL as-is.</p>
<p>However, without &quot;Money&quot; in the name, the URL might not be as memorable to new users who would only see this site referred to as &quot;Personal Finance&quot;.</p>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p><strong>Let's do it.</strong> It would also be advisable for Stack Exchange Inc., coincident with removing the &quot;&amp; Money&quot; part, to also add a domain name alias for the site:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>personalfinance.stackexchange.com</code> should be added as a permanent redirect (301) to the existing <code>money.*</code> domain name.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think we could do a lot better at being clear in the help center about issues that are settled within the community. I'd also like for us to make that resource explain a little better WHY the decision was made so we don't have to repeatedly do so when questions are closed for not being appropriate.

<p>This is where I might differ from other mods. I think I'd give more latitude to such question because ultimately the community sets the standards for what is welcome here. If we draw too hard of a line I think it is detrimental to the success of the site. Yes, we don't want a free-for-all, but sometimes we can bend the rules slightly if it benefits the site. I know this opinion may not be popular. If you disagree strongly, I respect that and your decision not to elect me moderator.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How will you contribute to a strong culture that welcomes new users
  and rewards good behavior from established users?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Be nice. Help people adjust with constructive criticism. Adopt a helpful tone. Give people a chance to fix their posts before closing them, re-open when they do fix them. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How will you address the community if your feelings about the
  direction of the site are in conflict with the community's agreed upon
  direction as decided in meta.money?</p>

<p>If the community and majority of other moderators disagree with me, I'll back down every time. The community will rule this site, not me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What role does community history have in guiding the future of the
  community?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Precedent is important, but I'd generally weigh the input of current active users over the ghosts of users past. Gotta be flexible to the needs of the community as they adapt.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How will you react when a user lashes out at you, accusing you of
  being a {bully|idiot|a poor excuse for a human being} after you {close
  a question|delete an answer|delete a comment}?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, I'd try to listen to their concerns and consult the other mods to make sure that I truly didn't deserve it, and fix the complaint if I am in the wrong. But if that didn't work I'd let it go, life is too short to get upset about what random people on the Internet think about me.</p>

  <p>In your opinion, what do moderators do?</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Arbitration</strong> - When the community can't reach a clear consensus, the mods should be familiar enough with the site rules, conventions, and precedent to settle issues that aren't being resolved on their own.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Janitorial Staff</strong> - SE has great tools to let the community mod itself to some degree, but having designated mods imbues responsibility on a select few to make sure the garbage gets taken out even when it is a chore. Solves the problem of ""In a Star Trek world, why would anyone clean toilets for a living?""</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Liaison</strong> between the SE team and the site's community. Communicate requested changes up, and implemented changes down as necessary.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recruiters</strong> Not an explicitly stated role, but as a moderator I'd feel an increased responsibility to promote the site and find ways to grow the community.</p></li>

The community has been against that move for a long time, but as other SE sites close, we are getting more and more ""well, where then"" questions.

1965,9379,,2,,5,1949,,,0,,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I'm deferring this for now. </p>

<p>Initial concerns when the proposal was still incubating revolved around ""Personal Finance"" and ""Money"" <em>not</em> being mutually exclusive in any context, and therefore redundant. We've grown to realize that there's a bit more wiggle room <em>within interpretation</em> than we believed, which is how we've arrived to this discussion. </p>

<p>Given that:</p>

<ul>
<li>We have a codified design in place, with branded promotional items</li>
<li>The URL itself remains <em>money</em>, which would be <em>extremely</em> difficult (practically impossible, as in could be a six month drop to almost no traffic) to change</li>
<li>There's not really any conclusive evidence that dropping money, while keeping the URL the same will have any profound impact</li>
</ul>

<p>... we're reluctant to consider the change <em>at this time</em>. While having ""&amp; Money"" provides a cop-out for not reading the enormous amount of help we give users asking their first question, I don't feel that taking it out is going to make much of a dent.</p>

<p>The size and establishment that you've achieved is commendable - this site has come <em>quite</em> a long way. However, with that, you're going to see your share of off-topic, or marginally on-topic questions because <em>people are going to try floating them in the hopes they receive an answer before they're closed</em> - no design or UI change is going to prevent that. </p>

<p>If we can come up with compelling evidence that the change would <em>prevent</em> the majority of these, we're open to discuss it again - which is why this is marked as deferred.</p>

<p>Minor changes to text only work when people read <em>and</em> care, and I just don't see the rewards of this being large enough to justify the work involved. I'm not saying that it won't help, I just don't believe it will help enough. </p>

I speak mainly as a contributor to Code Review, where we <a href=""https://codereview.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1438/9357"">recently had MathJax enabled</a>.  So far, the reaction in the Code Review chat room has been overwhelmingly positive, and performance impact has been negligible, even on mobile devices.  To avoid unintentionally triggering MathJax, Code Review has opted to use <code>\$</code> instead of <code>$</code> as delimiters (following in the footsteps of <a href=""http://electronics.stackexchange.com"">Electrical Engineering</a>).</p>

<p>By not supporting MathJax, Personal Finance &amp; Money is probably missing out on many good questions and answers, such as <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/q/767888/77144"">Math for Future Value of Growing Annuity</a>, which went to Math SE instead.</p>

<p>While it is possible to get by without MathJax by resorting to <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/a/10070/14744"">LaTeX-like ASCII symbols</a>, good notation aids effective communication.  The Math SE example above would just be too complex for any pseudo-LaTeX notation.  Also, MathJax doesn't just let you write formulas — you can also create <a href=""https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/40821/9357"">tables</a>.</p>

<p>So, yes, the question is opinion based.  But there are some formulaic opinions that are accepted as best practices that could be applied as answers.</p>
<h2>But why?</h2>
<p>You can also look through a lot of questions about &quot;how do I save money&quot; or &quot;what should I do with my leftover budget&quot; or &quot;where to start investing&quot; and see that this community does have a somewhat standard response.</p>
<p>Your comment was technically correct, but it amounted to &quot;depends&quot; and some advice to &quot;ask a more specific question&quot;.  What you might have missed is that for some of our community, knowing how to ask such a specific question is itself the problem that needs to be answered.  For money.se, it is important to see the not the question as they wrote it, but what they <em>probably meant.</em>  That is presumptuous to a degree, but if people knew what they meant on the more basic questions they could go somewhere else and find the answer.  Our community has a several year history of welcoming basic understanding questions as well as the hardcore semi-pro day traders.</p>
<p>I liked the direction and tone of the two answers I see right now:  they could be expanded a touch, but they are good.  Both of the answers on the question prompted our poster to think deeper (and hopefully ask follow up questions) about setting goals and how one might achieve them.  When I answer questions, I lay out a road map that works for beginners because, they have to start somewhere.  Ideally, our community will be welcoming, new users will stay around and progress far past the 101 type questions.  But we need to allow the 101's and help them on their way.</p>

<p>Now, I've spent the last while on meta trying to find out whether or not my question is on topic. You see, I'm a software developer and my wife is a stay at home mom. Somehow, what started as a hobby has turned into a furniture store. Not a store in the traditional sense, as we're online only. Basically, I keep her website running, and she handles, well, everything else. </p>

<p>For about a year, it was a partnership. As I understand it, from <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/a/16/3093"">this answer</a>, if it was a personal business that we were running, a question about managing those finances would be on topic. Last week, we incorporated it on the advice of our advisor at the bank.</p>

<p>Now, what I'm trying to do is enter our records starting from about November last year to current. During the time that I'm stuck on (which would be, well, the first few records... yep, I'm getting my feet wet) it was a personal business and seems to be exactly like it would have been in the answer linked. In fact, part of the justification of doing this work is because we want to make sure our 2013 taxes are in proper order. We didn't have very much for sales at the time, it was low enough that the business doesn't need to file taxes. But we still want to get it right.</p>

<p>In summary, my question is a very mechanical question on double entry accounting. I'm not sure how I should go about splitting the various transactions into the different buckets and all that jazz, and I'd like to ask the question here. It does relate to corporate finance, but the timeframe I'm asking about relates more to personal finance as we were not incorporated at that time.</p>

<p>The Hong Kong question has several answers giving different advice.  One late answer is actually specific to the Hong Kong location, and seems to contradict most of the other answers.</p>

<p>A close read of the questions reveals that they have different motives as well.  The Hong Kong asker wants to add money to the account in order to purchase something over his or her credit limit.  (Most of the answers address this.)  The UK asker has not given any indication that he or she wants to make a large purchase, only that he wants to pre-pay his credit card transactions before traveling abroad to avoid interest charges.</p>

<p>The second question on the other had is to use Credit Card like Debit Card. The cash withdrawl aspect is very distinct from a credit card to a debit card. i.e. even if one has positive balance on the credit card, there will still be charges applicable on cash withdrawl over and above what would have been for a debit card. This aspect is irrelevant in the first question as the intent of OP is very different.</p>

<p>The fact that they happen to both discuss pre-paying is really incidental.  I don't know the answer to either question, but you could easily answer the first question ""No"" and the second question ""Yes,"" and you would have no problem logically, because they are different questions.</p>

<p>Littleadv, I sincerely hope you do not leave. Your reputation here is well-earned. Your answers are insightful and have taught me a great deal. If you do decide you have to leave, I hope you leave your answers in place because they are informative and valuable.</p>

<p>On other, non-stackexchange sites, I've been trolled, had somewhat strange threats made which were meant to put my employment in jeopardy, and had my life specifically threatened. So I would understand if you chose to leave and to delete (or have someone else delete) your posts. It's unlikely that you'll feel better in a day or in a week, but I do hope that your current frustration some day passes, and you are able to resume your excellent contributions.</p>

<p>We as a community need to do a better job of making sure interactions never get anywhere close to this. money.stackexchange.com helped me through an incredibly difficult period of my life and I have always appreciated the care and effort people, including litteadv, put in to their answers.</p>

<p>Don't take it too hard to have a question closed, everybody does.  Our goal is to make the Internet better.  I have had questions and answers closed and deleted too; it is just a part of the process.</p>

<h1>Why the question was closed</h1>

<p><strong>First:</strong> The question is still about your economic situation.  Yes, you are personally affected, but what can you really do about it?  Or, more specifically, what can people generally do about it?  (Move?  Deal with it?)  The information as to ""why"" you seek is academic (very interesting, I think many of us here enjoy economics as much as you seem to) but economics are generally off topic.</p>

<p>The reason (in my opinion) the financial literacy about bonds is still open is the action-abilty.  When we compare your examples about bond prices, visitors here can do something to their portfolio based on the knowledge they got from the answer.  When they know the economic effects of why their housing is more expensive, the realistic options for most people are ""deal with it"" or political.</p>

<p><strong>Second:</strong> the post was closed before all the edits.  Based on what I saw for the original versions it certainly was off topic.  Interesting, but off topic for our site.</p>

<p><strong>Third:</strong>  the community reviewed your edits as a candidate for re-open and it didn't pass.</p>

<p><strong>Finally:</strong>  you found some old questions.  One of them does seem off-topic by our current standards.  We have grown and shifted as a community over the years and there are certainly some inconsistencies between two years ago and today.  (However, your question is still valid and please don't hesitate to ask for clarification.)</p>

<h1>Suggestions for question writing on Money.SE</h1>

<p>Explain what you have noticed economically, and ask about how to take advantage of the situation?  (<em>""Housing is a getting expensive, based on my situation, how can I take advantage of the rising prices?""</em>)</p>

<p>Ask about money saving possibilities (<em>""My stars it is expensive to live in downtown London, what are some proven methods to get a good deal on a lease?""</em>)</p>

<p>The key is to ask a question that has a definite answer, doesn't require a 10,0000 word essay to explain and is (as much as possible) timeless.  Writing good questions is hard.  You will notice most of the high rep people have a bunch of answers, but few questions.</p>

2048,4345,-1,1,,3,,66,2,0,,,Community Promotion Ads - 2015,<discussion><community-ads>,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>The dawn of a new year, 2015, now approaches, or has already approached, either way it means that it is now time for the site's first new cycle of Community Promotion Ads!</p>

<h3>What are Community Promotion Ads?</h3>

<p>Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.</p>

<h3>Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?</h3>

<p>This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:</p>

<ul>
<li>the site's twitter account</li>
<li>financial blogs and websites</li>
<li>cool events or conferences</li>
<li>anything else your community would genuinely be interested in</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal is for future visitors to find out about <em>the stuff your community deems important</em>. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are <em>relevant to your own community's interests</em>, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. </p>

<h3>Why do we reset the ads every year?</h3>

<p>Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.</p>

<p>The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>

<p>The answers you post to this question <em>must</em> conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>All answers should be in the exact form of:</p>

<p>Please <strong>do not add anything else to the body of the post</strong>. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.</p></li>
<li><p>The question must always be tagged with the magic <a href=""/questions/tagged/community-ads"" class=""post-tag moderator-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;community-ads&#39;"" rel=""tag"">community-ads</a> tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.</p></li>

<h3>Image requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li>The image that you create must be <strong>220 x 250 pixels</strong></li>

<p>And that doesn't mean they are trolling.  Looking at the intent of the person who hates being rated by a credit score, I'd categorize them as rugged individualist, not a pot-stirrer.  Whereas the whole life insurance salesman was clearly trying to undermine the site and generate business.  (There is a smaller chance that was a honest person testing his training materials, but I doubt it.)</p>
<p>What I am saying is <em>the intent of the question is about eschewing credit and living life.</em>  The poster tried to frame it in a way that his <em>actual question</em> would be answered while not dealing with the unlikely nature of the circumstances.  (Perhaps they failed.)</p>
<p>Which is why the answer was so good; it didn't deal with the flawed premise, only the question asked and still managed to deliver a good fundamental point about having a credit score.</p>
<p>Basically, the OP didn't find that magical way of asking the question elegantly.  The question is good (if you can peer through the fog of its sentence structure).  If anything, that question could be closed as a duplicate, but I am fine with what happened.</p>
<h1>Poorly worded questions can still be answered</h1>
<p>This same line applies to that insurance pitchman.  JohnFX gave a great fundamental answer to a question with a bad premise.  The pitchman was trying to sell insurance, and failed miserably in the face of facts.  (In fact, if you don't happen to agree with the pitchman that whole life is a good product,  you couldn't have asked for a better outcome.  Best thing in the world for somebody looking into whole life to find in bing searching.)</p>
<h2>Make the Internet better</h2>
<p>The best solution of all is to cajole the poster into rewriting the question in a better way.  In the case of our latest lottery winner, I would have:</p>
<ol>
<li>Asked if his question was a duplicate of X and Y or Z?</li>
<li>If the OP still insists they aren't dupes, get added clarity about the premise (if it bothered me so).</li>

<p>You said that the question has already been asked and answered.  If it is a duplicate, close it as a duplicate.</p>

<p>For the sake of argument, let's assume that the OP has some sort of agenda.  Imagine that the question was asked by Dave Ramsey using an alias, and he has the view that credit scores are worthless.  He didn't state that in the question, and he didn't say it in an answer.  So assume good faith and answer the question the way you think is best.  If someone posts an answer you don't like, downvote it.  Voting will take care of the answers.</p>

<p>When a question like this is closed quickly, it makes it look like the members of the community are afraid of the answers to the question.</p>

<p>Let's look at the <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/43140/why-do-billionaires-buy-life-insurance"">billionaires buying life insurance question</a>.  The OP clearly has an agenda.  He has posted three very poorly received answers that have been downvoted into oblivion.  He has accused the site of suppressing his viewpoint, which is hogwash.  And yet, when he posted a question in which he invited answers against his own viewpoint, instead of answering the question, three users closed it.  (One moderator was able to get a very good answer in before the question was closed.)  It almost legitimizes his accusation, that the mainstream users of the site have no response to his viewpoint.</p>

<p>Instead of closing a question like this, answer it.  Even if the OP has a crackpot viewpoint (which I don't think is the case here), there are lots of other people who are looking for the arguments against the crackpots.  We can provide that.  This is an opportunity to answer the issue legitimately and make the internet a better place.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>""I wouldn't take swimming lessons from a guy who never went into the water and tried it himself.""</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well put. As the guy who had the, um, brilliant idea to start this place, I'll avoid speaking in the abstract and instead I'll actually give you some facts about my own situation:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>My family is debt-free. We have no outstanding mortgage, loan, or credit card balances of any kind other than revolving credit on cards that we pay off in full each month. We like the convenience of credit, and use no-fee cards with points.</p></li>
<li><p>We have a net worth that places us, statistically, <em>somewhere</em> (being purposefully vague) in the top quintile (20%) with respect to other Canadian families&mdash;and that group includes families with breadwinners at more advanced ages (i.e. closer to the end of their wealth-accumulating years.)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Both of those facts at least <em>suggest</em> to me that we're on our way to meeting our goals.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I know we're not there yet. It isn't hard for me to calculate that if we didn't work at all, we would drain our financial assets well before we'd reach our own retirement ages&mdash;and even if the markets were to reliably provide decent (but not spectacular) returns.</p>

<p>So, we've got a long way to go before we are <em>financially independent</em>, i.e. depending on no source of income other than what our investments generate. I continue to hope for, but not count on!, many years of spectacular returns so the way can be shorter, but more realistically there will be (and have been) rainy days along the way. I've enjoyed the flexibility and luxury of taking some, ah, ""calculated risks"" with my career that I might not have otherwise taken if we lived paycheck to paycheck.</p>

<p>But I can say <strong>without a doubt</strong> that practicing&mdash;most of the time&mdash;the kind of advice I teach has had a significantly positive impact on our family finances, and I know when it comes time to send the kids to university that we won't be scrambling to pay the tuition*.</p>

<p>UTMA (Uniform Transfer to Minors Act) and UGMA (Uniform Gift to Minors Act) accounts are very similar to each other.

<p>It's still a grey area. I personally haven't voted on the Celebrity one, but I agree with Dilip's quote in your question. And with 4 close votes, it seems others agree. </p>

<p>The second question was brought up by me in Meta, and left open. The question seems valid, what prompted my meta question was the ""if I won the lottery"" approach, but the question wasn't touched, just discussed.  </p>

<p>In my opinion, the line is grey because there are valid questions about goals. ""I'm saving at this rate, when I get to $xxx how do I ...."" might be a good question, or it might not. </p>

<p>The insurance question was written by someone with an agenda. He placed multiple answers in a short time, and when I commented, inviting him to produce data but cut back on the rhetoric, I saw no response. He was pushing a product but offering no facts to support his position. </p>

<p>From the quote above, the board is about helping people solve actual issues they face, it's not a discussion board. Keep in mind, the mods frequently get flags to address off-topic questions, and since our vote actually closes a question, it's sometimes a tough call. </p>

<p>It seems that a situation you might face can be on topic, but it's a matter of degree. This is my opinion, it's not like mods have a special extra manual to consult. If there's a closed question you'd like re-opened, you can vote for that as well. </p>

2078,11604,-1,2,,12,2076,,,1,,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I'm glad to see this question, as I was just going to ask it myself.  This has become a pet peeve of mine.  I strongly believe that we should <em>allow</em> questions about personal finance even if they are not directly about the asker's personal experience.  To me, the ""personal"" in ""personal finance"" means questions should be related to decisions made by individuals about their own individual finances, not necessarily decisions made by the questioner about his or her own individual finances.</p>

<p>There are two main reasons I think this.  First, there are many questions not about the questioner's own finances that we do and will continue to accept, and there is no clear, reasonable basis for separating them from ones we wouldn't accept.  Second, we do not need to use ""it's not you"" as grounds for rejecting wild hypothetical scenarios, economics questions, etc.; when we need to, we can reject those questions on the basis of their actual content, not who asked them.</p>

<p>What I mean with my first reason is that ""personal finance"" obviously includes decisions about people other than the individual asking the question.  Consider, for instance, questions about a spouse's finances, children's finances, siblings' finances, parents' finances, elderly senile parents' finances, a friend's finances, a poor-with-no-reliable-internet-access friend's finances, a roommate's finances.</p>

<p>There are lots of valid reasons to ask a question on someone else's behalf.  The person in question may not have the ability to ask the question themself.  The questioner may be trying to help someone close to them who, for whatever reason, cannot or will not take the time to ask.  People don't waste their time asking questions that they don't care about on some level; if someone asks a question about someone else, we should assume that they are asking it due to a personal connection with that person.  <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/26543/friends-come-with-hat-in-hand-but-i-dont-think-it-will-help"">This question</a> is an example of a highly-voted question that is really about someone else's finances: the questioner is asking about how to help his friends who have poor financial habits, and the (good and upvoted answers) are largely about how to help these friends solve their problem, because the questioner is not in any real financial trouble himself.</p>

<p>The same applies to questions that are hypothetical but may become real in the future.  If someone, for instance, asks questions about how to handle issues that may arise when their old and frail mother passes away, are we to refuse to answer until the death has actually occurred?  If someone asks whether it's a good idea to buy stocks when they are down, are we supposed to wait until stocks are actually at a 10-year low?  No.  We should trust that people ask questions that are relevant to them at the time that they ask them.</p>

<p>My second reason is that rejecting questions based on who asks them doesn't really gain us anything.  A question like ""Is a graduate-student stipend taxable income"" is good regardless of whether the person asking it is a graduate student receiving a stipend, because many graduate students receiving stipends do exist and may find the question helpful.  A question like ""Why won't Switzerland join the Eurozone"" is not about personal finance no matter who asks it.</p>

<p>As for hypothetical scenarios, we don't need to reject those on who-asked-it grounds.  A question like ""What is the safest investment in the event of a meteor strike"" has no real answer, even if it asked by someone who genuinely believes a meteor will strike the earth.  Questions that are hypothetical <em>but realistic</em> should be accepted, because even if the questioner is not facing them, real people may indeed face them (or may have faced them in the past).  For instance, when politicians make noises about changing financial laws (e.g., Obama's recent aborted proposal to eliminate 529 plans), I would consider it reasonable for someone to ask if there are financial actions they should take if the law in question is passed.  It's hypothetical, but it's a reasonable thing to consider.</p>

<p>A final point is that, since we have no way to verify that anyone actually has the issue they mention, trying to restrict questions on this basis is pointless.  If the person who asked the celebrity banking question edited it to add ""P.S. I am a celebrity but won't say which one to protect my privacy"", does that mean we should then answer it?  If someone asks the meteor strike question and says ""P.S. I'm asking because I looked up at the sky with my telescope last night and saw a meteor approaching"", would that change our stance towards the question?  As long as the questioner can provide enough plausible details to admit of the possibility of an answer, I think we should assume they are drawing the details from their experience rather than their imagination.  There is no way to really know.</p>

<p>So basically what I'm saying is that I think ""personal finance"" is a <em>topic</em>, and the topic restriction is a restriction on <em>questions</em>, not questioners.  Questions that are <em>about</em> personal finance are on-topic even if the person asking the question is not the central party involved, as long as the question describes a situation in which there would be some central party making a personal finance decision.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The questions I vote to close that would fall under that category are ones that are either highly speculative, or seem to be looking for a debate.</p>

<p>The <strong>insurance for billionaires</strong> question was by a person with an agenda. </p>

<p>The <strong>Value of credit score if you never plan to borrow again</strong> question is similar to one on the front page right now: <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/45183/defaulting-on-early-termination-charges-out-of-a-phone-contract"">Defaulting on early termination charges out of a phone contract</a>. These are impossible to answer because even if you can list 5 bad things the OP will just say those aren't important. Or modify the scenario to be even more impossible.</p>

<p>Another category of question I watch out for is the asking for a friend, but there is likely a hidden agenda. An example is <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/45140/avoid-exorbitant-costs-when-forced-to-break-a-lease"">Avoid exorbitant costs when forced to break a lease</a>. The title of the question calls the costs exorbitant, but the cost may be in what is specified in the contract, and what is allowed by state law. Of course we will never know because the OP doesn't have the contract. Nor were they a witness to what was said between the landlord and the renter. The only answer is to review the contract and the information from the state. That info from the state will also specify what the landlord has to do try and re-rent and how the renter can challenge the landlord. </p>

<p>Many of the questions we are talking about here are worthy of closure.  Some are unclear: because the situation doesn't apply to the OP, not enough information is given on the situation, and it is unclear what he is asking.  Some are too broad, because the hypothetical situation set up by the OP does not give enough detail to be answered in a concise manner.</p>

<p>But I think that, too often, the reason being cited for closing these questions has been ""This situation does not apply to the OP, and therefore is not allowed to ask the question.""  This is not, and should not, be a valid close reason, and doesn't help the OP learn how to ask a good question.</p>

<p>Just a quick note that I am stepping down from my moderation duties.  I will no longer have a diamond by my name, but I will still be reading the site and participating when I can.  Even after 5 years, I still spend more time learning than I do teaching on this site, which is pretty rad.</p>

<p>Thanks to everybody for making a fun and easy group to moderate.  Everybody who comes to the community has a kind heart (except for those bum spammers...) and is obviously interested in helping other people the best they can.</p>

<p>Big thanks to JoeTaxpayer and JohnFx, who are really fun people to work with, and I won't forget the team who taught me how to mod including the site's founder, Chris Rea.</p>

<p>Perhaps some of your have noticed that my job and family life are getting more of my time as times moves on, so I wanted to get out of the way and let another one of our very capable and calm community members the opportunity to work with the StackExchange people and mod the site for while.  </p>

<p><em>And if you have considered running in the next election, please do so.  I can't imagine a real world job you have that wouldn't benefit from some of the things they teach you as a mod.  (All you programmers especially, you will see how software and real life come together in a world class way.)  The community team at StackExchange are very friendly and will offer as much (or as little) guidance as you want.  It is a super experience.  If you have the means, I highly recommend picking it up.</em></p>

Post answers to this question containing any questions you would like to ask the candidates. Please only post <em>one question per answer</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>We, the Community Team, will be providing a small selection of generic questions. The first two will be guaranteed to be included, the latter ones are if the community doesn't supply enough questions. This will be done in a single post, unlike the prior instruction.</p></li>
<li><p>This is a perfect opportunity to voice questions that are specific to your community and issues that you are running into at current.</p></li>
<li><p>At the end of the phase, the Community Team will select <strong>up to 8 of the top voted questions submitted by the community</strong> provided in this thread, to use in addition to the aforementioned 2 guaranteed questions. We reserve some editorial control in the selection of the questions and may opt not to select a question that is tangential or irrelevant to moderation or the election. That said, if I have concerns about any questions in this fashion, I will be sure to point this out in comments before the decision making time.</p></li>
<li><p>Once questions have been selected, a new question will be opened to host the actual questionnaire for the candidates, containing 10 questions in total.</p></li>
<li><p>This is not the only option that users have for gathering information on candidates. As a community, you are still free to, for example, hold a live chat session with your candidates to ask further questions, or perhaps clarifications from what is provided in the Q&amp;A.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>You can read them for yourself to form your own opinion, but it seems to me that the consensus is that questions should not be closed purely because they are asking about unethical activity.  A number of the answers make the point that there are various levels of response, ranging from ""just answer with no comment about the ethics"", ""answer with comment about the ethics"", ""do nothing"", ""downvote"" and ""flag"".  At least one answer also suggests that if the question asks about activity that is likely to bring negative consequences for the asker (e.g., ""how do I break the law in X way?""), you can answer saying ""Don't do that, you will go to jail/be sued/ruin your professional reputation/alienate your family/etc.""  This kind of answer may not be what the questioner is seeking but can nonetheless be the most pertinent advice.</p>

<p>My own feeling is that questions about how to be a big meanie should be allowed, but may not get answers that actually help the person to be a bigger meanie.  For the question you linked to, I agree with Ganesh Sittampalam that, although it sounds like the questioner is being shady, we don't know the whole story so it's hard to judge.  Moreover, in that case the question itself (""are chargebacks possible with paypal?"") seems clearly legitimate and could be asked for legitimate reasons, so we would be closing it solely on the basis of the asker's perceived intent, which I think is too much.  This is in contrast, for instance, to conceivable questions like ""Can I buy something from my own business with a credit card to circumvent cash-advance fees?"", where the entire concept at issue is ill-advised and against the rules.</p>

<p>I also think that PayPal-chargeback question is unusual in that there's no apparent attempt by the asker to conceal the fact that he's trying to give the other person the shaft.  I can imagine questions where the ethical issues are so serious and so blatant that I would support closing the question (e.g., ""How can I bamboozle my wealthy senile grandmother for financial gain?""), but I think in most cases if the potential damage is so great, few people would be brave or foolish enough to ask the question directly.  So, basically, I think we are unlikely to see many questions that are both ethically dubious enough and forthright enough about it that explicit closure is warranted on purely ethical grounds.</p>

<h2>Duties</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Handle flags</strong>; but that is easy because the other mods will help and the StackExchange team is very friendly and supportive.  The community flags stuff and you make it the best you can for the site.</li>
<li><strong>Welcome new users and guide them</strong>; you will get a sense pretty quickly oh who is going to stay and who won't.  This isn't really any different than the responsibility you have <em>now</em> as a long time, high rep'd user.  (You just get better tools.  You don't need to be any more proactive than normal I found.)</li>
<li><strong>Respond</strong> to the occasional StackExchange employee request.</li>
</ul>
<p>That isn't a whole list, but it what came first to my mind.</p>
<p>The mods are elected by the community because they are already respected members of the community, so the biggest job is to keep doing what you are doing.  I could say stuff about fairness, keeping calm, spending a bunch of time hunting spam, blah blah blah.  The SE team will share all of that with you.  The truth is that you probably won't notice a huge increase in 'required' work if you visit the site a couple of times a day anyhow.</p>
<h2>Differences with your non-mod day to day</h2>
<ul>
<li>You should probably leave the browser window open or get one of the apps installed so you can quickly respond to alerts.  My visits became more frequent just because I responded to chats or flags.  However I did it while at my regular job so it wasn't a huge time sink.</li>
<li>I found the power of the tools to be almost too much at first.  My votes just closed things.  My edits just happened.  I could move comments and content.  For me, that made me back off on some of the minutia.  I just about stopped voting and clicked &quot;skip&quot; a ton.  I didn't want the community to think I was editorializing.  Most mods I know expressed a similar sentiment.</li>
<li>You will feel pretty sweet the first time you obliterate a spam account.  The word destroy might give you a high.  I really relished being able to destroy spam accounts.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Expectations I had that didn't happen to me</h2>
<ul>
<li>For me, I thought I had to start reading the questions that didn't interest me, just to look for stuff and be aware of what is going on.  Honestly, this community is mature enough that you don't really need to.  Do what you do.</li>
<li>I was afraid I would have to make a bunch of tough decisions with vicious or malicious users.  Didn't happen.  Sure, there were times when folks didn't see eye to eye, but it happened once and the SE team was there to support.</li>
<li>I feared I would blow up the site / ruin content.  Turns out the SE programmers are pretty competent.  If anything, I didn't get far enough into stuff.</li>
<li>I was afraid I couldn't keep up with the work, but that never happened.  There are plenty of mods, plenty of support.  If you are busy and don't hit the site for a couple days, it isn't a problem.  Taking a holiday break?  Never an issue.</li>
</ul>
<p>Stepped down because I am getting busier at work and at home, and as much as anything it is time to let someone else in the community get invested as a mod.  It is honestly a fun experience, and one that made me feel even tighter to the community.</p>

<p>I was never first a ""regular"" user. I didn't separate the moderator time from all the rest of my activities related to promoting a new site. I spent a <em>lot</em> of time obsessing about whether or not the site would succeed, wondering whether it was growing fast enough, worrying about when it would have metrics impressive enough to graduate, as well as pestering Stack Exchange about graduation :)</p>

<p>Of course, things are different now:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We graduated and so the site is a full-fledged Stack Exchange community. <em>(Whew!)</em></p></li>
<li><p>Through all our years and the many thousands of questions, the community has figured out reasonably well what should and shouldn't be on-topic. This mitigates what was once a far more frequent source of issues.</p></li>
<li><p>The user community has grown a lot and matured well. There are <em>many</em> high-rep and valued users (including some, <em>ahem</em>, former moderators) and they're generally doing all the right things: welcoming others, providing quality answers, up-/down-voting, flagging issues, voting to close questions, posting comments seeking clarification, improving posts, adding tags, etc.</p></li>

2107,10997,-1,2,,8,2106,,,5,,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>As the comments have already mentioned, downvoting spam really doesn't cost you any rep at all.  Downvoting questions never costs rep, and downvoting answers temporarily costs 1 point, but if the answer gets deleted (as it will with spam), you get your point back.</p>

<p>However, it is still recommended that you not downvote spam and simply flag it instead, per this Meta.SE question:</p>

<p><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/193916/232449"">Why shouldn't I downvote spam that I've already flagged?</a></p>

<p>The reason given is that downvotes hide the spam from the front page, making it less likely that it will get the required number of spam flags to delete it completely without moderator attention.  Downvotes don't really hurt the spammer's rep, since they likely have a rep of 1 and the account will be deleted soon anyway.</p>

<p>Having said that, I still question the importance of this recommendation.</p>

<p>The whole point of deleting spam is so that people won't see it.  If it gets downvoted enough to hide it from the front page, then fewer people will see it, and that is a good thing.</p>

<p>As soon as it gets one spam flag, more people will be able to see it and flag it in the review queues.  There are several review queues it could show up in: First Posts, Close Votes, Low Quality.

<p>My recommendation is definitely flag any spam you see; that is important.  If you happen to downvote it as well, I don't think it matters much.</p>

2110,10997,10997,1,,16,,299,2,4,,,Guidelines for asking for/editing country tags in questions from new users,<discussion><questions><country-tags><tagging><new-users>,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>Information on the location of the question asker (country tag) is important for answering many questions on this site.  And, unfortunately, needing to continuously ask new users for their location can get annoying after a while.  That having been said, there has been some troubling behavior in this regard recently.  Here are some guidelines to follow when confronted with a question from a new user that has no country tag.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>First, ask yourself: Does this particular question <em>need</em> a country tag?  Some questions are universal and really don't need it (e.g. debt reduction strategies).  On the other hand, questions that touch on taxation, laws, or regulations often do need it.</p></li>
<li><p>Are there <em>location clues</em> in the text of the question?  If the question uses U.S.-specific terms such as ""1099"", ""401K"", or ""IRS"", you don't need to ask the OP; tag it <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/united-states"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;united-states&#39;"" rel=""tag"">united-states</a>.  Similarly, for ""CRA"", ""RRSP"", or ""TFSA"", tag it <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/canada"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;canada&#39;"" rel=""tag"">canada</a>.  See ""HMRC"" or ""ISA""? Tag it <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/united-kingdom"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;united-kingdom&#39;"" rel=""tag"">united-kingdom</a>.</p>

<p>And so on. Yet, remain mindful that ambiguity is possible. Tag only when confident.</p>

<p>Another clue might be found in the user's profile.  The user may have already provided his or her location in the user profile.  Before asking the user for their location, click on the username and check the profile.  If you see a location listed there, just add the tag.</p></li>
<li><p>When you do need to ask, do so <em>respectfully</em>.  It is unreasonable for us to expect every new user to automatically know that a country tag is expected.  The fact that they didn't include it doesn't say anything about their attitude or intelligence; it only means that they are a new user.  Insulting the OP and/or insulting every person of a particular nationality is clearly against the StackExchange rules and should never be tolerated.  Belittling an OP does not teach them to ask better questions; it only teaches them that this community is full of jerks and that they are not welcome here.</p></li>
<li><p>If it is not clear which country the question is about, do not edit the question with a guess (unless you have evidence for the country; see #2).  You may or may not be right with your guess, but guessing wrong confuses the OP, and if the OP comes back and edits the question with the right country, any answers that have already come in will be instantly invalidated.</p>

<p>Instead, if you want to write a good answer that is country-specific, make sure you specify in your answer that it is valid only for a particular country.  Just be aware that if the correct country is known later, your answer might get downvotes.</p></li>
<li><p>Alternatively, if the question <strong>cannot</strong> be answered without country information, voting to close as either ""unclear what you are asking"" or ""too broad"" is acceptable.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Any feedback you may have to improve these guidelines is welcome.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>If the sensitive information is not necessary to the question I would edit it and remove revisions with the sensitive information from the history. If the sensitive information is relevant to the question, I would disassociate it from the user perhaps through community wiki depending if the user is active and wishes to remain active on the site. If the user doesn't care deleting their account is also an option.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Comments are expendable, and I wouldn't hesitate to clean them up when they cross the line. People who make valuable contributions often have strong opinions, so certainly arguments will arise (as they have on this site). I think more than just deleting the offensive stuff a moderator should reach out and try to help users resolve their differences amicably. That may not always be possible, but that doesn't mean we don't make an effort to understand both points of view and try help them to do the same.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My first step would be to ask the moderator what the reasons were. Maybe they saw something I didn't. If after that discussion I still disagreed, I'd ask the other moderators for their views. If I was the only one who thought it was a problem I would drop it. With the current group of moderators I can hardly imagine a scenario where we would have strong disagreements.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In your opinion, what do moderators do?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Moderators are given greater leeway to clean-up the site in ways that average users can't (and shouldn't be able to) by quickly deleting spam posts and otherwise dealing with flagged content that can't be removed by the rest of the community through votes to close, etc. Moderators also mediate disputes among users as they arise hopefully helping everyone to feel that they are valued and encouraged to continue to make good contributions.</p>

<p>I don't know that I expect it to make me more effective. Instead it would focus my attention on tasks that cannot be done by others, but which still need to be done for the good of the community. I would still review new posts, but I would be less likely to take action against them unless they were unambiguously violating the rules. If it's a judgment call, then I would let the community exercise their judgment in voting to close.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I think this question has a slightly different nuance than the <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/220314/2014-so-moderator-election-qa-question-collection/220347#220347"">equivalent one for StackOverflow</a>, because the ethical and legal arguments for respecting the user's wishes are stronger.</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2102/366"">comments from existing/past moderators</a> make it clear that anonymizing the question is an available option and for me it would at the top of my mind as the likely outcome.</p>

<p>Before asking for that, I'd investigate if the question could be changed to retain its essence but avoid the personal information, perhaps in conjunction with removing the edit history.</p>

<p>In extreme circumstances, if for some reason the question couldn't be properly anonymized even by disassociating it from a user account, I'd reluctantly support its removal, after discussion with the rest of the mod team. I can't really envisage circumstances where a good question with good answers would be in that situation though.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Firstly, I would do my level best to treat each incident in isolation, at least when dealing with that incident. It's very easy to get into a mindset of ""oh, XXX again"" and assume the worst. It's important for the user to feel they are being treated fairly if at all possible. Of course if they are not at fault in a situation then there's no need to take any action at all.</p>

<p>Secondly, if there was an opportunity to have a quiet chat with the user about their behaviour, I'd do so, hopefully after discussion with the rest of the mod team. I'd try to focus on how their contributions are really valuable but their behaviour is detracting from them.</p>

<p>Thirdly, high-rep users shouldn't get special treatment in how we respond to incidents involving them. If they do post inappropriate material or whatever then it does need to be dealt with. If it happens repeatedly to the point that suspension is an appropriate sanction for any other user, then it should be applied to the high-rep user too.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Firstly, I'd apply some hysteresis. If another mod made a different decision to the one I'd have made on a borderline issue, it's probably not worth the cost of changing it now even if I'd prefer it to have been done differently in an ideal world.</p>

<p>So I'd reserve any action for significant issues where I think it might really be worth changing that decision, or for where I want a discussion about what should happen if the same issue comes up again.</p>

<p>Next, I'd discuss this with the moderator team as a whole, in private. I'd want to know what the reasoning behind the decision had been and what other moderators thought, if anything. This is a route without much sense of confrontation, I'm sure that most mods would be very happy to discuss their reasoning. I certainly would be.</p>

<p>That might have a few outcomes. The other mod might change their mind, I might change my mind, or the moderator team as a whole might reach a majority view as to the right course of action, that was also acceptable to the minority even if they disagreed with it.</p>

<p>If the right course of action is still not clear, the next place is probably an open discussion on meta, unless it would require disclosing some private information. Even if there is a consensus amongst the moderators it might be worthy of a discussion on meta to see if the community feels the same way or to explain our approach.</p>

<p>The StackExchange team would no doubt be able to help out with really difficult problems, as would looking around at how other sites have handled them or asking on meta.stackexchange.com.</p>

<p>In a really intractable situation where I felt a very important decision had been handled in an unacceptable way and not been reversed after discussion, I might end up resigning. I think it's vanishingly unlikely that this would end up happening in practice.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In your opinion, what do moderators do?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The standard answer to this is ""human exception handlers"", i.e. deal with the difficult cases that can't be handled by the normal site review processes available to suitably privileged users. For example dealing with drawn-out arguments in comments, users misbehaving, deleting spam.</p>

<p>I also see a role for helping to guide the evolution of the site's policy on meta. This is something that any user can participate in, of course. However the general experience of the community moderators as a whole should be important in helping to inform such discussions.</p>

<p>I also think it's important that moderators get involved in welcoming new users to the site. This is something anyone can do of course, but I think it's a particular responsibility of moderators to help set the tone and generate that kind of atmosphere.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think in some cases, when just participating in the site as a normal user, this is a negative thing. I'd rather not have any extra weight attached to my opinions sometimes.</p>

<p>On the other hand I think it's also valuable to have users around who can speak with authority, for example when explaining basic policy points to new users on the site or stepping into protracted arguments that aren't resolving themselves naturally.</p>

<p>I've been in the occasional argument myself on the site - perhaps three or four times in the site's history - and I've hopefully managed to behave reasonably well during them, including stepping away when it was clear it wasn't going anywhere, and flagging for a moderator if necessary. If I were a moderator myself I would be even more careful about getting involved.</p>

<p>I'd also aim to clearly separate expressions of opinion from statements of policy.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For me the main thing is being able to help share the load of the <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2101/366"">standard tasks that fall to moderators</a>. The diamond provides an extra stamp to welcoming comments that can hopefully help new users use the site well. Deleting obvious spam as soon as possible would be nice, as would being able to quickly close obviously off-topic questions.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I think I would be more scared to use close votes early on borderline questions. For those I'd prefer to be one of five votes, rather than a single binding vote. Other past moderators and candidates have spoken of this problem too, and I think it's a real problem - but then there are plenty of other people able to cast close votes, so hopefully not too much of one.</p>

<p>Moderators shape and guide the community by making small course corrections along the way.   Very rarely are moderators making large shifts in direction for the community.   This involves both encouraging positive behaviors and discouraging negative behaviors.  That encouragement/discouragement can be done through comments, edits to posts, chat and discussions on meta as well as modeling the desired behavior.</p>

<p>No team of moderators can fully edit and review all the content on a stack exchange site. </p>

<p>Moderators are also responsible for handling the occasional bad seed in the community with an appropriate response.  </p>

<p>I am primarily interested in shaping and directing the community through small steps.   My actions will primarily be taken through commenting and editing questions which are both available to me now and available to people with far less reputation than I currently have.   This is behavior that I did while I was moderator before and I continue to do now while I am not a moderator.   The effect of adding me to the moderator list would be that the changes I make to add clarity to questions would be seen as a model for the community more than just one person trying to make a difference can achieve.   I hope that by being a moderator I help to make the community even more self-sustaining than it already is.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The best solution I've seen to this specific problem is to anonymize the question (removing personal information and de-associating it with the user).  What I would actually do in this case is to talk to the more experienced mods first, and assuming they agreed, partner with Stack Exchange staff as needed to make sure we agreed on the correct course of action and then to implement it.  Anonymizing the question can be complex, in particular with the edit history and caching (once something's on the internet, it's there forever) but we should do what we can to protect the privacy of our posters.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After discussion with the other moderators, the first course of action is simply to have a conversation with the user.  The question here isn't specific as to why the flags and arguments arise; it may well be due to unintentional actions, and in my book, good intent should be assumed first. In many cases, posters are unaware of the reason for others responses to their actions, and may simply need a small change to improve.</p>

<p>If the conversation is not effective, either because the user does not see a problem or does not want to or cannot change, then I would have further conversations with the moderating team, and discuss our options.  One option would be to simply more heavily moderate their posts - inserting appropriate comments to avert arguments, particularly if the poster isn't the problem per se so much as the types of comments his or her posts tend to generate.</p>

<p>Any further action I'd expect to be taken based on significant conversations with other moderators and likely the SE community team.  I don't tend to believe in suspensions except in extreme situations.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would bring it up in moderator chat, and ask why they moderated that post.  If we couldn't come to an agreement, and both felt it was important, one or the other of us should open a post in Meta to discuss it with the community.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In your opinion, what do moderators do?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I strongly believe in the <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/"">theory of moderation</a>.  This is how I moderated before when I was a moderator on a gaming forum, and it's how I would moderate here.</p>

<p>Moderators first and foremost represent the community.  They should be the friendly greeter at the door, who remind new posters about the rules set by the community, remind old posters of the rules they helped set, and generally oil the wheels to keep things flowing.  They are empowered to quickly delete spam and other kinds of obviously ""bad"" posts, but should be very cautious in removing posts that have room for improvement - instead encouraging those to be improved.</p>

<p>They also are the bridge to the StackExchange staff when needed - whether the community has a concern with the software or the system, or if a particular user needs additional help, or if there is a problem user who is making the community worse for the rest of us.  </p>

<p>At the core, though, moderators are simply other members of the community - not necessarily even the best and the brightest, but members who have proven that they understand how the community operates and how Stack Exchange operates, and are willing to give some of their time to help keep things cleaner and run more smoothly.  StackExchange's model is community moderated, and much of that moderation occurs from users without diamonds; every one of us who hits ""review"" or ""edit"" or ""close"" or ""flag"" (or many other links) is a moderator.  The diamond just means we have a bit easier time doing some of those tasks, because the community believes we know how to identify posts that need closing, deleting, protecting, or the many other tasks we can perform, and that we promise in exchange that we spend some time performing those tasks regularly (as needed).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I am entirely comfortable with that; I'd never say anything I didn't feel comfortable saying regardless of status.  I have before said things I regretted, but the diamond wouldn't have changed that; being a good person is something one should strive for regardless of position or official status.</p>

  <p>In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Primarily by allowing me to help delete spam and other diamond moderator-only tasks that currently are being performed by only two people.  PF&amp;M never has very large of a close or LQ queue, and so that doesn't really have a strong impact on things - we're pretty good about moderating ourselves, diamond or not.  As a diamond moderator I'd simply be helping to lower the workload of the other moderators, and hopefully helping make decisions more and more over time when they come up as I got a better sense of the community from that point of view.</p>

<p>I would spend more of my time on the site as a result of the diamond; I feel moderators should spend a certain amount of time greeting new members to the community, reading posts, and otherwise showing the flag. I do that some already, but I would do some of that more as a result of the responsibility (in particular, doing it some <em>every day</em>).</p>

<p>I think we should be careful about being too aggressive with this, though. The query picked up a number of quite recently closed questions, including several that are still new enough to be described as ""on hold"" instead of ""closed"". That language is deliberate, to encourage the askers to think that there is a way back for their question by editing.</p>

<p>Many of the questions still look unsalvageable to me despite that, but in the particular case of <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/48300/non-resident-owning-stock-not-stock-options-in-us-c-corporation"">What Capital Gains are owed for a Non-resident owning stock in US C corporation when it is acquired?</a>, I think deleting it was wrong so I've undeleted it for now. We can always delete it again if necessary.</p>

<p>In particular, it's only two days old, had been edited since being closed, and has now gathered two reopen votes. Personally I also think it should be reopened but I'm not sure if I should cast a binding vote to that effect. Either way, I think for now it should still be visible on the site.</p>

<p>I'd suggest that in general we don't delete any ""on hold"" questions unless they are obviously unsalvageable, as per the <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/93606/132930"">definition of ""very low quality""</a>.</p>

<p>For older questions, the <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5221/how-does-deleting-work-what-can-cause-a-post-to-be-deleted-and-what-does-that/5222#5222"">""Stack Exchange roomba""</a> should clean up a lot automatically. For the closed questions being targeted here, anything with a score of 0 or less will be deleted after 9 days of being closed or last edited. A lot of the ones you identified had score 1, so one option would have been to nudge them to be cleaned up organically with a downvote.</p>

<p>Personally I think it would be great if the community as a whole would get involved in keeping the site clean, either by downvoting or voting-to-delete these old questions. Posts like yours are a great way to identify things they should be looking at.</p>

<p>If we have more eyes reviewing old stuff we might perhaps catch the odd one that is worthy of some further attention. For the ones that did manage to get an upvote in the past, someone must have thought them worthwhile.</p>

2125,10997,-1,2,,12,2124,,,3,,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>This is a difficult question.  Most questions about legal matters will have a financial component.  And many questions about finance deal with laws.  Where do we draw a line between what is appropriate for this site, and what is not?  Here is what I propose:</p>

<p>We should make questions about <strong>legal disputes</strong> off topic.  By ""legal disputes,"" I mean questions that are clearly about a real dispute between two individuals.  Here is why:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In any question about a legal dispute, we are only hearing one side of the story.  There is no way for us to find out which details we are not getting.</p></li>
<li><p>It will generally be impossible for us to get all the information we need.  Without reading a contract, we really can't know who is right in the dispute.</p></li>
<li><p>It is not appropriate for us on this site to take sides in a dispute.  Let's say for the sake of discussion that we are given every piece of information we need.  We know the jurisdiction, we have a copy of any contracts, and we have all of our questions answered.  It still would not be appropriate, in my opinion, for us to take a legal side in this matter.  That is what courts are for.</p></li>
<li><p>If the asker gets the wrong answer here, when they really need to contact a lawyer, it is very bad for them.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>A question asking about what a quitclaim deed is, or the process of using one, might be on topic.  <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/q/48361/10997"">This question (How to get a girlfriend off a quitclaim...)</a>, however, is clearly a legal dispute between the OP and his girlfriend.  As is, it should be off-topic, in my opinion.</p>

<p>I suspect that this will be a gray area.  For example, under this rule, <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/q/47289/10997"">this question (How do I get out of this disastrous situation?)</a> would have an on-topic component and an off-topic component.  The on-topic portion would be dealing with the lease, and the off-topic component would be dealing with the boyfriend.  The on-topic portion is probably enough to keep that question open.</p>

<p>I don't think this rule is much different than what has already been happening on this site; however, this would give us something to add to the <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">on-topic page</a> that we could easily point to and say, ""Sorry, off-topic.""</p>

I can't view the linked question now since it was deleted, but I think questions on such matters are often simply off-topic as they are not really financial in nature.</p>

<p>As a counterpoint to Ben Miller's answer, though: I think we should be cautious about rejecting <em>questions</em> just because they are about a real dispute.  If an <em>answer</em> gives incorrect advice or wrongly leads the person away from contacting a lawyer, etc., when that is what they really need to do, then that is a problem with the <em>answer</em>.  We should not close questions just because they <em>might</em> lead to bad answers.</p>

<p>Many questions that seem to be of the form ""How can I resolve dispute X with person Y"" may allow for answers that provide information on the underlying personal-finance issues without attempting to actually resolve that particular dispute.  (For instance, we have seen many questions about credit-card disputes with merchants or issuers that can be answered with information on how credit cards work, how user liability is limited by law, how problems may be avoided by switching to a different bank, etc.)  I think answers can give useful and relevant information on many such matters, even if the original asker feels unsatisfied because his/her individual issue wasn't ""solved"".</p>

<p>In short, we should not reject questions that ask for advice on a specific dispute.  We should just not give answers that fall into the traps Ben Miller mentions when they try to resolve that specific dispute.  Instead, we should give useful information on the topic of the dispute, insofar as we can.  (Of course, there are certainly questions that don't provide enough detail to even take a stab, and I think it's fine to close those as unclear if the asker doesn't edit to add needed info.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But what do the empirical evidence and academic studies prove? Which is recommended?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>""Primarily opinion-based"" is often a judgement call - some questions do require some degree of subjective judgement to answer, but still aren't <em>primarily</em> opinion-based. However I think this question does fall on the wrong side of the line.</p>

<p>It's unlikely that there will be clear cut empirical evidence or academic studies that <em>prove</em> anything. In the end any answer will be someone's opinion about which is better, even if an informed, academic opinion.</p>

<p>Another possible problem with the question is that it's inviting a list of academic resources, and list questions are <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/98366/132930"">discouraged on StackExchange</a>.</p>

<p>I think it might be possible to ask a question about this area and keep it on-topic, perhaps by asking a more direct question that focuses on concrete trade-offs rather than asking which is better. For example, someone commented on your question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Recommended for what? The two approaches trade different amounts of risk for different returns.</p>

<p>I think a question about the relative risks and returns of the two investments would be on-topic. The answers to such a question would be reasonably factual, rather than coming down to an explicit recommendation of one strategy over another.</p>

The offer is from Capital One Bank (a major US financial bank), and it's for a 1.1% APY interest rate savings account. They also provide a $100 signup bonus if you open the account with the minimum balance, which is an extra 1% for the minimum $10k.</p>

<p>Today is June 27, 2015 and the US Federal Reserve lending rates are all under 1%. The saving account rate is quite attractive as it's over twice the rate of the savings account I have through my credit union and about 30% higher than CD's I can get for balanced under $90K (which I don't have).</p>

<p>The complication is this: I don't have any other accounts with this bank, so it would be quite a hassle to set up, maintain, and ultimately retrieve the funds. The minimum opening balance is also higher than my cash reserves, so I'd have to scrape together a few extra funds to 'lock in' their 'promotional' rate.</p>

<p>But my question wouldn't be about the hassle. My question would be about the typical terms for promotional, luring rates for this. I basically want to know how common it is for the savings rate to be cranked back down to the currently typical 0.1%~0.2% rates as soon as the promotional period is over. I imagine they're playing it as close as they can with these terms to avoid lawsuits for false advertising and bait-and-switch. After all, a $100/account (1-2% commission) isn't that high in terms of marketing budgets.</p>

2141,4392,-1,1,,2,,51,0,4,,,Where to ask questions about pricing models?,<discussion>,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>A little while ago I asked this question on SuperUser:</p>

<p><a href=""https://superuser.com/questions/940355/how-to-create-a-data-series-for-exponential-decrease-diagram"">https://superuser.com/questions/940355/how-to-create-a-data-series-for-exponential-decrease-diagram</a></p>

<p>I wanted to find a formula for pricing my products in spreadsheets, so that I could price them fairly such that the more usage would have more discount.</p>

<p>However, based on the answers, I found out that the resulting chart would be something like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bOdtv.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Which is absolutely wrong. Because it financially means that ""if you buy 4000 units you should pay more than when you purchase 8000 units"". Of course it doesn't make sense. Now I'm trying to find the data series that can create an increasing amount of payment which results to a linear pattern. But I can't figure it out, and my mathematical knowledge is not helpful here.</p>

<p>Where can I ask questions of this kind?</p>

2142,11424,-1,1,,2,,262,3,2,,,"How should I respond to accusation of my answer being a spam, due to ignorance and laziness?",<discussion><quality-evaluation><down-votes>,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I have recently written <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/a/50227/11424"">this answer</a> that in my opinion provided a very concrete help with the OP's problem, based on the Stock Repair Option  Strategy. None of numerous highly voted answers even remotely mentioned this useful idea that any serious investor should be aware of.</p>

<p>To my great surprise, my answer was accused to be a spam for providing a link to the relevant description page by Chicago Option Exchange, the world's major option exchange! Not only calling this link a spam makes absolutely no sense to me, but in contrast - this is the best and cleanest education source I've seen. In fact, I would challenge anyone to find a better source!</p>

<p>It is not like my answer consisted of that only link. With 8 written paragraphs I would say it was slightly more than that. </p>

<p>It is not like that link, if broken in the future, would reduce the quality of the answer. Any basic ""googling"" that broadly used term (Stock Repair Strategy) would provide sufficient information, even if not so clean and condensed.</p>

<p>It is not like my answer would improve a lot by copying any explanation to that broadly used strategy, for which there are numerous much better sources easily to be found. In contrast, my answer provided exactly the supplemental information.</p>

<p>The ""arguments"" as to why my answer was a spam I learned from the discussion were:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It was not clear how my answer was related to the question</p></li>
<li><p>I might be affiliated to the organisation linked</p></li>
<li><p>The essence of my answer is basically a complicated way of gambling</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now I have to ask:</p>

<p><em>Can these arguments be due to anything other than lack of basic knowledge plus lack of interest to learn about stock options, laziness to spend 1 min reading that page prominently explaining the reasons, and ignorance in general?</em></p>

<p>And - the main question - how should I respond to such judgemental accusations?  </p>

<p>I have added that description as quote in my answer, which apparently was all the answer was missing. It is, however, so prominently displayed on the page linked or can be found by googling, that I have to say at the risk of repeating myself :) - basing any judgement on the lack of that can only be due to basic ignorance and laziness.</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT.</p>

<p>I suppose what offended me was perceived lack of respect for the time it took me to write this relatively long answer. In my opinion, there is a big difference between posting a 1-2 sentence spam link and a longer answer with detailed explanation. I would challenge anyone to show me many true spam answers of that size! Even a single one :)</p>

<p>While I appreciate the annoyance of seeing spam, I consider myself capable of identifying and dismissing those without any moderator help. What appears spam to some, can be useful to others. And it something potentially useful was marked as spam and/or deleted by careless moderator, that effectively deprives all the community from that chance to learn something new and useful. Not mentioning the discouragement for the author to share further useful information. </p>

<p><em>There is a lot to lose for the community to mistakenly mark potentially useful answers as spam and I disagree with the attitude to take this lightly. There is much less harm simply doing nothing and leaving it at that.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>Now speaking about the CBOE site, it does indeed, unfortunately, has fair bit of advertising. However, I have to ask:</p>

<p><em>How much of a freeloader does one want to be? The fellas work hard to write a clean and simple presentation, nicely structured with useful examples! All given away for free! How else are they supposed to earn money?</em></p>

<p>So every site using 3rd party advertising is to be regarded as spam???
Are we not eliminating 99% of internet? :)</p>

<p>And further, those ads can actually be useful to some people! If not - why would anyone pay for them? </p>

<p>And in case of CBOE - at the risk of repeating myself, I have to insist that the page displays the core information as prominent as can only be possible. Despite of the 2 (admittedly annoying) ads, that information is in no way obscured. It takes under 30 seconds to read that useful information to decide if the page is useful! </p>

<hr>

<p>Another aspect that I find puzzling is how my answer is specific to the US options. Is it? Aren't options equally used everywhere? </p>

<hr>

<p>In my opinion, a less harmful approach from the side of the moderator, would be to raise a suitable question in the comments and give the author a chance to answer it, <strong>before</strong> mentioning any suspicion or accusation or <strong>anything negative</strong> whatsoever. </p>

<p>If you meet a person in a pub in a cozy environment and suspect he wants to sell you something - are you going to stand up and loudly announce your suspicion for everyone in the pub to know? I presume not. But what happened here is exactly that if you just think about it.</p>

<hr>

<p>Another thing I perceive as ignorance is calling an option strategy ""gambling"" for no mentioned reason. Are options gambling? Are stocks? Is this an opinion of a moderator in this forum?</p>

<p>I have further explored the site and found numerous high quality expert level discussions of options. It makes even me even more surprised to see a moderator calling a known proved option strategy, used by many traders, a ""gambling"". </p>

2143,187,,2,,2,2142,,,3,,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>The answer is we are all human and subject to mistakes. A link to a CBOE article should not have been considered spam. The mod handling it is new, not in the US, and I'm guessing, not familiar with options trading. </p>

<p>A combination of multiple factors that correlate with spammy behavior probably caused a user's spam alarm to fire a false-positive, and they raised a flag for a moderator.</p>

<p>Here are the factors that likely played a part in this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It is a high-traffic page with >10,000 views. Such pages are often targeted by link spam.</p></li>
<li><p>You hadn't posted to the site before. Link spammers are almost always first-timers.</p></li>
<li><p>The link was to a domain not all would easily recognize as benign. Not everybody here is familiar with U.S. options trading. Though you and I might know exactly who the CBOE are, and their role in the options trading world, many more wouldn't.</p></li>
<li><p>Other than the link content itself, your answer text didn't mention the CBOE, who they are, or why you were linking to them. Link spam answers frequently link without explanation, too.</p></li>

2145,366,-1,2,,5,2142,,,15,,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>Firstly, apologies for not being aware that this was a standard reference source - we could have avoided a bit of discussion if I had realised that.</p>

<p>We get quite a lot of answers - maybe one or two a week - that make at least a vague attempt to be relevant but nonetheless appear to be spam/site promotion. In this case the flag stated:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Potential site promotion. It does not directly answer the question</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I respond to flags of that nature, I consider a few different factors in deciding how to proceed:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><em>Does the link seem like spam?</em></p>

<p>In this case the website actually looks quite spammy, with several adverts and lots of links to ""Special offers"". This is also a classic pattern of spam reference links where a site claims to be explaining some concept but is really just trying to sell something.</p>

<p>Even after taking a much closer look now I still think the only thing that sets it apart from that is the CBOE name.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Relevance of the answer</em></p>

<p>A lot of the answers that are really aimed at site promotion are peripherally relevant to the question but don't really make an attempt to address it directly.</p>

<p>I thought that was true of your answer (pre-edit), and I still do. It's a <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225370/your-answer-is-in-another-castle-when-is-an-answer-not-an-answer"">well-established StackExchange policy</a> that answers should make sense without following links or consulting external resources. There's also some <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/help/promotion"">guidance on this in the FAQ</a>.</p>

<p>As a reader, I want to know why the answer is worth considering <em>before</em> I click any external links or start searching the Internet. Without the introductory material you've now added, the answer seemed to me to be a random strategy for gambling on a stock price with no specific connection to the asker's original problem - by ""gambling"" I mean short-term speculation rather than investing or hedging.</p>

<p>Certainly that judgement reflected my own ignorance of this particular option strategy, but I suspect that ignorance would be shared by the original question asker and many other users of the site. </p>

<p>So as a moderator thinking about how relevant an answer it was, I was also judging it by those standards. That's not exactly laziness, though of course I do also limit the amount of work I do to handle each flag - I don't exhaustively research every possible avenue to understanding the post.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Status of the poster</em></p>

<p>You were new to PF&amp;M, which is the typical case for spam users. On the other hand, you did have an established account elsewhere on the StackExchange network, which somewhat negated this factor.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Overall I thought it probably wasn't spam, but I wasn't entirely sure, so I left the answer up and added a comment briefly summarising the above opinions so I could gather more information:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Could you explain a bit more about what this has to do with the OP's specific problem? Also, do you have any connection to the site you've linked to? At present the answer gives the impression of being spam/promotion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm sorry if my comment came across as an attack, which wasn't my intention - I just wanted to explain how your post was being perceived by others. As I told the flagger, my plan was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I've left a comment asking for clarification, but I can't see any obvious connection between the poster and the site, so I'll leave it up for now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you hadn't responded to the comment I'd probably still have left your answer up, but also left my comment as a warning to other users to treat it carefully. As it was, the very fact that you bothered to respond made me pretty confident that there wasn't any problem, and I deleted the comment as planned after a bit more follow-up discussion.</p>

<p>In much more extreme cases (e.g. affiliate links, or completely off-topic material) I would typically delete at that stage - with the possibility of undeleting later if the initial judgement did turn out to be wrong.</p>

<hr>

<p>So, to answer your actual question, the simple way to respond to an ""accusation"" of spamming is just to engage with the person asking. If we bother to ask then we are at least open to the idea that there's a good explanation. Any kind of reply at all sets you apart from the typical ""drive-by"".</p>

<p>Also, for you personally, the next time you post you won't be a completely new user so it's even less likely that any moderator would think you were spamming.</p>

<p>One of the items that is explicitly <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic""><em>on</em>-topic</a> on this site is ""Consumer issues or consumer protections.""  It is true that sometimes when a question of this type gets asked, the first course of action should be to contact the customer service department.  However, we all know that this doesn't always lead to a good conclusion.  We don't want to discourage consumer-related questions.  We don't want to give the impression that any situation that could possibly be handled by a company's customer service department is always off-topic here.</p>

<p>Let's present a hypothetical situation:  OP just got his phone bill, and there is a charge he does not recognize on it.  He runs to his computer and fires off a question to Money.SE: ""What do I do about this bogus charge on my phone bill?""  A helpful Money.SE user leaves a comment: ""Have you called the phone company and asked what they have to say about this particular charge?""</p>

<p>Let's say OP replies: ""No, why would I do that?""  We close the question as ""Too broad"" or ""Unclear what you are asking.""</p>

<p>Let's say OP doesn't reply at all: We could close the question in the same way.</p>

<p>Instead, if OP replies: ""Yes.  They told me that I signed up for the optional protection plan on my phones, but I did not.  They refuse to remove the charge.""  This is a question we could answer.</p>

<p>As an aside, in my opinion, we close enough questions on this site as it is.  We don't need to make it easier or quicker to do so, especially for questions like this that are really on-topic.</p>

<p>Moderator elections are held periodically to determine who the community moderators will be for a given site.</p>

<h3>What are community moderators?</h3>

<p>Moderators are site users who have been elected by the community based on not only their knowledge in the topic domain, but also because they are:</p>

<ul>
<li>patient and fair</li>
<li>lead by example</li>
<li>show respect for their fellow community member in their actions and words</li>
</ul>

<p>Moderators have the very highest level of privilege in our system:</p>

<ul>
<li>Moderator votes are binding. Any place we have voting (close, open, delete, undelete, offensive, etc), that vote will reach the threshold and take effect immediately if a single moderator casts a vote.</li>
<li>Moderators can lock posts. Locked posts cannot be voted on or changed in any way.</li>
<li>Moderators can protect posts. Protected posts cannot be answered by new users.</li>
<li>Moderators can see all data in the system, including votes and user profile information.</li>
<li>Moderators can place users in timed suspension, and delete users if necessary.</li>
<li>Moderators can perform large-scale maintenance actions like merge questions and batch retag.</li>
<li>Moderators have access to the moderator flag queue</li>
</ul>

<h3>How do community moderators work?</h3>

<p>The following guidelines are provided to all our community moderators, and all moderators of any type are expected to abide by them:</p>

<ol>
<li>As a moderator, your actions now represent our community; please act accordingly. You are in a position of the highest trust.</li>
<li>Your goal is to guide the community with gentle — but firm — intervention. <strong>Respect</strong> your fellow community members at all times; demonstrate <strong>fairness</strong> and <strong>impartiality</strong> in your actions.</li>
<li>Keep the discussion reasonably on topic by providing visible feedback to indicate where and why things have gone off topic.</li>
<li>Regularly check for and deal with posts <strong>flagged for moderator attention</strong>.</li>
<li>In the case of serious disputes, communicate directly with users via email to help <strong>mediate and resolve disputes</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<h3>When should I seek out a community moderator?</h3>

<p>Don't hesitate to <a href=""http://meta.stackoverflow.com/privileges/flag-posts"">flag posts for moderator attention</a> any time there is something you feel strongly needs to be brought to the attention of a moderator. And if it is extremely urgent, you can always mail the address provided in the footer.</p>

<p>The correct process that should follow is that it should be marked as a duplicate; and then, if the original poster agrees, left alone.  If the original poster does not feel the other post answers his/her question, they should either edit the question to more specifically address that issue, or ask a new question if needed (if it's too big of a change).</p>

<p>Those are basically duplicate questions, assuming the second is no more specific than that.  The second should be marked as a dup.  Then, if the OP is specifically asking ""Does the fact that it's my brother make a difference?"", then the question should be edited (or a new question opened):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is a loan without interest to a family member treated differently than a loan without interest to a non-family member?</p>

<p>Of course, the original question may include answers that cover the different kinds of loans, in which case the OP hopefully got their answer and moved on.</p>

2190,10997,-1,2,,7,2172,,,2,,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>My first experiences with Stack Exchange were on <a href=""https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/"">WordPress Development</a>.  Early on, I tried fixing the grammar on a few posts and got my suggested edits rejected.  The reason given was that the edits were too minor and not substantial.  So I quit doing it.</p>

<p>However, on a few sites now (including this one), I am a 2k user with the <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/edit"">edit privilege</a>, which means that my edits happen immediately with no approval needed.  I now edit grammar problems on those sites as I see them, and no one has ever complained to me yet.</p>

<p>This brings up one of the problems with making minor grammar changes: If you are a low-rep user, your edit has spent not only your time, but the time of at least two high-rep users to review your edit.  I can now understand the policy at WordPress Development: Posts over there often have poor grammar (but are intelligible), and they don't want to clog up the review queues with edits that are not necessary.  So they discourage low-rep users from making those edits by rejecting them.  High-rep users are free to make those changes, because the only time they are wasting is their own.</p>

<p>A second (lesser) problem occurs when you fix one grammar mistake and leave a whole bunch of others.  Other edits are then needed to fix the other problems, and then the question's revision history gets lots of entries in it.  This used to be a problem because once a question got edited several times, it was automatically converted to Community Wiki.  SE has since <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/203616/232449"">removed that <s>bug</s> feature</a>, so this is less of a problem than it used to be.  Still, if a question gets edited lots of times, it keeps popping up at the top of the front page, which might annoy some people.</p>

<p>A third problem happens if someone says to himself: ""I've got nothing better to do this afternoon, so I'm going to spend the next four hours going through old questions and fixing grammar.""  What happens then is that all of these old questions fill up the front page.  The new questions that people want to read then get pushed off the front page, and get less exposure than they would normally get.  This makes it harder for people to find the important activity on the site.  Use caution and courtesy when editing old posts.</p>

<p>A final problem that can happen is this: sometimes people change punctuation or reword sentences in an attempt to fix the grammar, but they change the meaning or make the grammar worse instead of better.  If you are going to make edits, make sure they are correct.</p>

<h1><strong>tl;dr</strong></h1>

<p>Fixing grammar on posts is good for the site, in my opinion.  However, be aware of unintended consequences of your actions.  Try not to waste others' time or annoy other users.  And if you are going to edit a post, review the whole post; don't fix one problem and leave others.  Finally, when you make a grammar change, make sure you are right.</p>

<ul>
<li>taxes</li>
<li>financial investments</li>
<li>real estate</li>
</ul>

<p>If you think about it, these categories, though distantly related, are really very different. There are many subsites on SE that are much closer related with each other.</p>

<p>I understand that traffic plays an important role and there just might not be enough interested users at this moment to allow the creation of subsites. But to just throw it all in one common pot doesn't seem right, too.</p>

<p>I don't know if it's even technically possible but if it is, I would suggest that each question must be qualified as one of the above mentioned categories (plus ""other""), and that questions on taxes need to have a country or at least region tag. Those few tags should be available on the starting page of Money SE for filtering. Because if half the questions page is filled with very US specific tax questions, non-US people might feel they're in the wrong place.</p>

<p>Hope this makes sense.</p>

<p>P.S. The tags don't have to be made mandatory per se. But if their use is suggested and the starting page would show the filters, as I've seen on other SE pages, users might be inclined to use them to their own advantage.</p>

2196,10997,-1,2,,4,2195,,,0,,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>As far as it being technically possible, the meta sites already have the ""required tags"" feature; each question on meta must be tagged with at least one of the required tags: discussion, feature-request, support, or bug.  However, I'm not aware of any non-meta site with this feature.</p>

<p>I'm not in favor of adding a ""required tags"" feature on Money.SE.  There are a few reasons.  </p>

<p>First, it would be too limiting.  You mentioned taxes, investments, and real estate as the top three, but actually, real estate is only our 13th <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/tags"">most used tag</a>, with 373 questions out of our 12,000+ total questions on Money.SE.  Credit card questions are nearly twice as common.  However, even if we correctly identify the three most common broad topics for questions, it doesn't make sense to require these; our <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">on-topic</a> page lists 10 categories of on-topic questions, listed in three headings: Investing &amp; Saving, Spending Wisely, and Sole Proprietorships.  We don't want to give the impression that questions that do not fall into the top three tags are not welcome here.</p>

<p>In addition, I think that an ""other"" tag would not be a good idea. It would not be very useful, and I believe it would be unprecedented; I've never seen an ""other"" tag on an SE site. </p>

<p>I am also not in favor of splitting our current site into separate sites. I would personally prefer the opposite; I wouldn't mind seeing the scope of the site expanded a little. </p>

<p>Although it might not be intuitive, it is already possible to do lots of <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/17003"">advanced filtering around tags</a>, including multiple tags and NOT tags, so if you'd like to eliminate questions tagged ""united-states"", you can do so.

<p>Should all of these categories of questions be off-topic?</p>

<p>Please note: I'm not arguing for or against any of the specific questions linked.  These are just recent examples of the classes of questions that I have noticed have been closed as a ""product or service recommendation"" question.  I'm only asking for general guidelines on what kinds of questions constitute a ""product or service recommendation"" request.</p>

<p>So to me there are 3 things happening;  </p>

<ol>
<li>Genuine closed where recommendation is being asked.</li>
<li>Some look like product recommendation but are know to seek info [for example API trading, tool for doing something]. </li>
<li>Asking if some info exists. More often the answer would be there may or may not be paid service [for example Nifty 150 intraday]</li>
</ol>

<p>I think from closing point of view, we have got most question right. There may be start few that maybe we shouldn't have closed. That I guess is bound to happen and hence we have the re-open process.</p>

<p>I guess the more serious issue is are we giving the right closure reason. I guess this is where more often we are getting boxed into picking easy options than type a specific reason.</p>

<p>I do think the reason description is somewhat vague. Sometimes, to me, it seems like a variation of the ""contact customer service"" rejection that I'd thought would be a good choice of standard rejection reason.

There are dozens of brokers but only the two I named that I am aware offer the charitable gifting account. </p>

<p>What this community apparently wants is questions on ""personal finance and personal money issues.""</p>

<p>It's no doubt true that if you read the help, you'll see that broader questions about money are out of scope, but <em>everything</em> else about the site enforces the idea that it's ""personal finance"" &amp; ""money"" (with ""money"" left broad, and the ampersand taken to mean union of topics, not intersection.)</p>

<p>It's not just the name but also, for example, the logo, which visually separates the ""personal finance"" from the ""money"" by using different scripts.  The list of active questions also tends to give this impression &mdash; depending somewhat on when a user lands on the page relative to when the moderators close and put on hold off-topic questions.</p>

<p>As a newcomer, it also seems to me that there's not a lot of consistency on calling some things in or out. (Maybe there is a consistency that I don't see, but that doesn't help.)</p>

<p>I don't think it's bad to keep the URL starting with ""money"" while changing the logo to ""personal finance"" only.  No one will ever notice except the people who hang out here now.  That would be a relatively easy change that would clarify what the group seems to want here.</p>

2211,,-1,1,,1,,142,3,2,user32479,user32479,"Why are accounting questions off-topic here, even though there are small business questions?",<discussion><questions><off-topic><site-information>,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I understand that questions about accounting are explicitly called <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">off topic for this site</a>.</p>

<p>I don't necessarily see why that is the case, especially since it seems at odds with the fact that questions about sole proprietorships are on topic and general accounting questions may be very relevant to owners of those businesses.</p>

<p>Is there some overriding reason to keep those questions off-topic?  Some historical reason that still carries weight?  Why not update the rules to make them on-topic and answer them?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>
Thanks to those who answered.  I started writing some additional comment on the answers, but then thought it might be more productive to make an edit here. I was not surprise that a lot those who responded wanted to keep this off-topic (otherwise it would already have changed).  I was surprised by the negative reaction to asking the question, and to some extent by the answers.</p>

<p>Let me try to put my question in better context, because it was motivated in part by what appears to me to be inconsistency in the way accounting questions are addressed on the site.  If you search for ""double entry"" (as in double entry accounting), you'll get 98 returns of questions and answers that apparently are considered on-topic.  A quick skim suggests that about 50 of them are genuinely about double-entry accounting, whereas the rest maybe just mention the term in passing.  Taking the top few as examples, the question has been couched in terms of some personal application of the technique, so I guess that's what keeps in on topic. The fact is though, most of these questions are just plain accounting questions.  When a person comes on the sight and asks essentially the same question but doesn't say they are doing it for some ""personal"" account, they seem to get routinely shutdown.  I can't see the closed questions anymore, but my impression is that this happens even when the OP doesn't say why they want to know, i.e. it could actually be for a ""personal"" reason.</p>

<p>Of course ""double entry"" is just one search term.  We could try the experiment of choosing some other common accounting terms - I didn't do that, but I think that for a good variety of them it would be about the same story.</p>

<p>Add to that, the help <em>explicitly</em> says that ""Sole Proprietorship"" with the bullet under that heading ""bookkeeping"" are on topic.  I'm not sure how you all understand that term, but my CPA uses it to cover a pretty wide range of basic accounting. Probably not all the way to GAAP and advanced topics, but definitely topics that fall squarely within accounting by any usual definition.</p>

<p>So, as I see it, you've got</p>

<ul>
<li>A backlog of questions that are evidently considered on-topic and answered.</li>
<li>The help (for those who actually go read it) that suggests that some accounting questions are on topic.</li>
<li>An apparently arbitrary distinction that a question that is fundamentally the same can be on-topic or off-topic depending on why the poster wants to know the answer.</li>
<li>There are accounting tags - gnucash, for example, comes up frequently in the search that I did.  I also see two tags for different versions of QuickBooks.  It seems strange that you would allow a tag for software and then filter based on why the poster wants to know something. (Usually, in my experience on these stack exchange family site, questions are on or off topic based on <em>what</em> is asked not <em>why</em> the poster wants to have an answer.)</li>
<li>Considering the relatively low volume on this site, a seemingly large number of first-time posters getting turned away for questions that might more appropriately be marked ""duplicate"" than ""off-topic.""</li>
</ul>

<p>This lead to my question of why not just take these questions and answer them all. (Or, I guess, alternatively, one might ask why not say they are all off-topic.)  The ""why do you want to know"" approach feels wrong.</p>

2212,1113,-1,2,,0,2211,,,3,,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>Accounting is very broad topic. </p>

<p>While basic accounting can be on topic and quite a few of us who do not have explicit accounting background answer the questions. There would be a vast majority of accounting questions that would be advanced and this site does not have enough expertise in answering them.</p>

<p>There are also pure accounting questions and applied accounting questions that again are a topic by themselves</p>

<p>Then are there tons of accounting practises [GAAP] adopted and vary from region and industry.</p>

<p>Creating a distinction would again become superficial and we may not be able to get it right. This would lead to incorrect user experience, he is coming to the site to get specific question answered and tons of unanswered questions results in friction and loss of value to site.</p>

2213,3,-1,2,,8,2211,,,5,,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I question your premise of:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[...] that questions about sole proprietorships are on topic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's not completely right. Rather, small business and self-employment questions &mdash; including sole proprietorships &mdash; are on topic <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/15/are-small-business-questions-on-topic""><em>when</em> they relate to the owner individual's personal income or compensation from the business</a>, including how taxes (at any level) can impact what an owner individual would realize from his business. That focus on personal income helps keep a small business question on topic <em>enough</em> for here.</p>

<p>Whereas if a small business or self employment question is about general business operations (marketing, widget making, contract law, and yes, <em>accounting</em>) then it wouldn't be on topic. We could easily drown in questions about how to run one's own business that don't <em>sufficiently</em> relate to personal finances, and so we draw a line. There are other sites for more general questions about <a href=""https://startups.stackexchange.com/"">starting a business</a> or <a href=""https://freelancing.stackexchange.com/"">freelancing</a>. Similarly, even though most people earn employment income, more general questions about <a href=""http://workplace.stackexchange.com"">workplace issues</a> belong elsewhere.</p>

<p>Allowing accounting questions for their own sake would lead to questions that are unrelated to personal finance. It would result in the current trickle of academic <em>""do my accounting homework""</em> type questions that we see turn into much more than a trickle ... or the <em>""help me program (or understand the implementation of) accounting system software""</em> type questions.</p>

<p>Besides, there is a perfectly fine <a href=""http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/82671/accounting"">accounting site proposal at Area 51</a> that people can support if they wish to see a Stack Exchange for accounting questions.</p>

<p>We have a similar prohibition against economics questions in general and for similar reasons, and there is an <a href=""http://economics.stackexchange.com"">economics site</a> (take 2) today that welcomes those questions. And we have discussed it <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/224/what-to-do-with-all-the-macroeconomics-questions"">before</a>, and <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1974/where-can-i-ask-questions-about-economics-not-related-to-personal-finance"">again</a>, and <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2201/expanding-the-scope-of-money-to-economics-etc"">again</a>.</p>

<p>While I'm at it, there are also better places for <a href=""http://quant.stackexchange.com"">quantitative finance</a> and <a href=""http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com"">Bitcoin and cryptocurrency</a> questions. Each one of these and other Stack Exchange sites I mentioned was established by a community interested in those subjects in particular, just like we are interested in keeping our focus on personal finance.</p>

2214,3,,2,,2,2207,,,2,,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>Along the lines of your examples, perhaps it would help if we drew up more specific templates for the off-topic question classes we are trying to avoid? For instance, here are some classes of questions that, IMHO, we should be closing as product/service recommendations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Where can I get [free/paid] [current/historical] [stock/company/fx] data?  </li>
<li>What [brokers/banks/credit cards/money transfer services] will let me _____ from _____?</li>
<li>Where can I find a [loan/mortage/funding] because _____?</li>
<li>What [service/software/app] should I use to track my [finances/budget/portfolio/taxes]?</li>
<li>What [service/software/app] has feature _____?</li>
<li>What specific [funds/ETFs/other financial instruments] are appropriate for me?<br>
<em>(steer such a question to discuss asset classes, not products)</em></li>
<li>Who is a [cheaper/better/faster/more reliable] provider of _____ services?</li>
<li>Where can I find an [advisor/accountant/insurance broker/other professional]?</li>
</ul>

<p>I also tend to look at questions this way: If the answer to a question could just be the name or a link to one or more product or service providers (whether with or without descriptions of the products/services, promotional or otherwise), then IMHO it isn't a question we want &mdash; it will attract spam and it will get out of date.</p>

<p>I'll call out a specific exception for questions and answers about government tax authorities (e.g. IRS, HMRC, or CRA) or other government departments relating to social/retirement benefits (e.g. SSA, Service Canada, etc.). I wouldn't consider public resources to be products or services per se.</p>

2215,11604,,2,,1,2207,,,5,,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I think there is room to be more permissive in this area.  To my mind, there are two main downsides to these types of questions.  First, they are too specific and thus often cannot get answers that will satisfy the questioner (sometimes leading to endless back-and-forth in comments).  Second, they tend to not be useful as references later (e.g., if found via Google search), again because they are too specific.</p>

<p>As with many close votes, I think we should try to restrain ourselves from closing questions that ask something specific if we can instead give a helpful but more general answer.  We should also be wary of knee-jerk close votes simply because the question mentions specific products/services; the question is not whether the question has to do with those specific products/services, but whether an answer would be useful to others.  An answer can be useful to people other than the original questioner because it applies to similar (but not identical) circumstances, or because the specific circumstances in the question are very common.</p>

<p>In practice, I think this means we should accept many questions that related to widely-used products and services.  I think there have been discussion on meta about this before, but personally I think questions like ""How can I do XYZ commonly needed task in Quicken/GnuCash/etc"" should be on topic, because lots of people use those products and the answers may be generally useful.  At an extreme, the S&amp;P 500, for instance, is actually a specific product provided by a specific company, but (I hope) we wouldn't think of closing a question simply because it was asking something about the S&amp;P 500.</p>

<p>Some of the other questions (like the ""which brokers offer a trading API"" or ""what is a good book about investing"") are more shopping-list like, but I think they often admit of good answers that simply sidestep the specifics.  When someone asks ""what is a good book about investing"", often what they actually mean is ""how can I learn about investing"", and that's a perfectly fine question.  So you can just write an answer that says ""Personally I liked this book, but there is also this website and this podcast, and those are some starting points for you to find resources that you personally would like.""  Likewise if someone asks ""Should I invest in this particular mutual fund"", often you can give a general answer about how to decide what to invest in.</p>

<p>In other words, people sometimes ask questions that are more specific than the ones they actually needed or wanted to ask, even if they're not aware of it.  If someone asks ""is X good"", the the question is often really ""<em>how do I tell</em> what is a good choice in this domain"", and that can be answered.</p>

<p>On a more general note, I think one way my perspective on this differs from that of many others is that I don't think it is a bad thing to have a fair amount of unanswered questions.  There are lots of good questions that probably have real answers, but that no one here knows the answers to.  That is fine.  We shouldn't close a question just because it happens that no one is around who can answer it.  We should close a question if we can't imagine anyone ever being able to give a generally useful answer.</p>

If you make it specific, i.e. you have X total in investments with x1, x2, x3 % in stocks, funds, gold, real estate, etc and should you diversify more or in general is there a standard bench mark on how much to diversify based on total investments .... this may be on topic.

<p>The basic on-topic litmus test for this site is this: Is it related to <em>personal</em> finance?  Many insurance questions will be.</p>

<p>For example, questions about health insurance, life insurance, auto insurance, homeowner's insurance, renter's insurance, personal liability insurance and even extended warranties are all on topic here.</p>

<p>Questions about corporate liability insurance and worker's compensation insurance are probably off-topic, as they are generally business-related.  However, sole proprietership/self-employed business questions are on-topic, so even these types of insurance might be the subject of an on-topic question.</p>

2225,27011,-1,1,,3,,57,1,0,,,At what point does a company become relevant to have its own tag? Or should they be combined?,<discussion><tags>,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I recently asked a question about the term Equal Housing Lender being used by p2p lenders. I noticed that there is a tag ""lending-club"" as well as ""lending"" and ""peer-to-peer-lending"" but there is no tag for ""prosper"" or ""on-deck"". There are however tags of large financial companies such as ""bank-of-america"". </p>

<p>Where do we delineate the point at which a company as a tag becomes relevant? At the point of writing both ""lending-club"" and ""bank-of-america"" have 12 mentions. </p>

<p>Something I noted was that there as no ""wells-fargo"". how much value do specific company tags really give (particularly given that over time policies are likely to change not to mention that different locations may vary ex internationally) and at what point does a company tag become relevant? If we do not have both say Wells Fargo and Bank of America does Bank of America really add great value? </p>

<p>I would argue that in most scenarios the company name has little value as a tag and can be outright misleading in regards to what the question is about particularly when we only have a tag for one of the companies involved. (looking at this: <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/bank-of-america"">https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/bank-of-america</a>) the specific bank is not all that relevant. Most banking practices are governed by location rather than a specific bank. </p>

<p>Examples include: 
<a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/39609/how-long-are-checks-issued-by-bank-of-america-valid"">How long are checks issued by Bank of America valid?</a></p>

<p>This one references both BofA and WF but only has a BofA tag:
<a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/49149/transfer-money-between-wells-fargo-and-bofa-accounts-for-free"">Transfer money between Wells Fargo and BofA accounts for free</a></p>

<p>and this one as well

<p>In terms of p2p lending and lending-club it seems to me that the majority of posts are clearly more relevant to p2p lending rather than a specific company. It just so happens that lending club is the market leader in p2p and thus it appears most people are talking about lending club rather than another company even though it seems most of the info applies to online lending and or peer to peer lending. See: <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/lending-club"">https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/lending-club</a>.</p>

2226,11604,,2,,3,2225,,,1,,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I hadn't noticed those tags.  I agree that it's hard to see why tags for individual companies are needed.  It seems like if the question is so tightly linked to a particular company that a company-specific tag is required, the question is very likely to be too specific to the questioner's individual circumstances to be useful to a wider audience.  (That is, it would likely be a customer-service question for the tagged company.)  In the examples you give, the tags add little or nothing to the question, and I don't see any reason why those tags need to exist.</p>

<p>Quoting myself <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20100424063223/https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5751/proposal-for-a-personal-finance-and-money-se"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">from six or so years ago</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This proposal is for a personal finance and money StackExchange
  site.  <strong>This is also a proposal to bring an existing SE 1.0
  site, <em>Basically Money</em>, into the StackExchange
  2.0 network.</strong></p>
  
  <p><strong>Topic</strong></p>
  
  <p>A site to ask any questions about personal finance or money from an
  individual or consumer perspective: saving money, spending money,
  cutting custs, investing, retirement, borrowing, taxes, interest
  rates, insurance, credit ratings and history, etc.</p>
  
  <p>While personal finance <em>can</em> be a localized subject (e.g.
  U.S. tax rules, Canadian retirement plan specifics, British government
  pensions) there is a lot more that can be discussed across geographic
  boundaries, so the site will support both <em>geography-neutral</em>
  as well as <em>geography-specific</em> questions through tagging. 
  (Consider how Stack Overflow enables a Java developer to answer a C#
  developer's question about algorithms or patterns.  Similarly, Brits,
  Americans, and Canadians could answer each other's questions about
  saving money, debt avoidance strategies, and so on.)</p>
  
  <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p>
  
  <ul> <li><p>Average working people looking to attain financial
  literacy and find ways to save their money, minimize their taxes
  (legitimately), invest their savings wisely, plan for their childrens'
  education savings, plan for their retirement, etc.</p></li>
  <li><p>Already financially-savvy individuals and do-it-yourself
  investors.</p></li> <li><p>Financial planning professionals such as
  Certified Financial Planners, or others in the personal and household
  finance industry e.g. mortgage brokers, personal bankers, debt
  counselors, etc. whose goal it is to assist individuals / consumers
  with financial planning, products, or services.</p></li>
  <li><p><em>[What other major groups may be interested?]</em></p></li>
  </ul>
  
  <p><strong>Disallowed Topics</strong></p>
  
  <ul> <li><p><strong>Extended discussion or recommendations for/against
  individual stocks.</strong>  i.e. no ""buy"" or ""sell"" recommendations. 
  While it would be on-topic to ask questions about technicals or
  fundamentals using a specific stock <em>as an example</em>, the site
  doesn't intend to be another ""stock board"".</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Gambling, lotteries, games of chance, wagers,
  betting</strong> &ndash; except it is permitted to discuss the
  taxation or investing of proceeds from such (legal) activities. 
  However, I suggest that gambling ought to have its own StackExchange
  site, if somebody is interested in proposing one.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Advanced economics.</strong>  However, economics from
  an undergraduate or layperson perspective is on-topic, e.g. to help
  people understand basic concepts of supply/demand, interest rate
  policy, etc. that affect consumers directly.  I suggest that, like
  Math Overflow for math, a separate site for advanced economics is a good
  idea.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Advanced personal tax topics or tax
  for business.</strong>  However, tax questions that commonly come up
  from a personal perspective are on-topic.  I suggest that a
  separate site for advanced tax queries is a good idea.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Advanced or pro finance / trading</strong> &ndash; e.g.
  in forex, commodities, futures, options, swaps as typically practiced
  by professionals / dedicated day traders and not by individuals.  I
  suggest that a separate site for advanced finance and/or trading
  topics is a good idea. </p></li> <li><p><strong>Questions
  promoting or describing how to do illegal or borderline illegal
  activities</strong> such as money laundering, smuggling currency,
  counterfeiting, income tax evasion, fraud, etc.</p></li>
  <li><p><em>[What else should be off-topic?]</em></p></li> </ul>
  
  <p><strong>Good Questions</strong></p>
  
  <ul> <li>What is value investing? What are the key principles of
  value investing?</li> <li>I just moved to the United States. What should I do to
  develop a good credit rating, fast?</li> <li>Are bank customers allowed to provide username &amp;
  password to sites like Mint.com?</li> <li>It is legal for a retailer/store or other business to
  refuse $50 &amp; $100 bills or other legal tender?</li> <li>What can I replace Microsoft Money with, now that MS
  has abandoned it?</li> <li>What is the difference between “good debt” vs. “bad
  debt”?</li> </ul>
  
  <p><strong>Bad Questions</strong></p>
  
  <ul> <li><em>[I'll come back and fill in some good ""bad question""
  examples later.]</em></li> </ul>
  
  <p><strong>Thank You!</strong></p>
  
  <p><em>If you support the concept of this proposal, please up-vote and
  voice your support.  I appreciate any and all feedback, comments,
  etc.</em>  </p>

<p>(It is interesting to see how the actual site definition has evolved over time; while some of what is above remains true for <em>Money</em>, some doesn't. The example ""good questions"" in my proposal aren't necessarily so, today.)</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>I'll add that, at that time many years ago when we were invited to submit a preliminary site proposal for a Stack Exchange 2.0 community, one of the guidelines was specifically to outline questions that ought to be considered off-topic, because one of the problems that existing Stack Exchange 1.0 sites were suffering from was lack of definition and a free-for-all approach to what might be considered on-topic.</p>

<p>And so I had thought to exclude questions about gambling/lotteries/etc. <em>except</em> insofar as those questions have an impact on one's personal finance. The intent wasn't to exclude <em>all</em> gambling/lottery questions, just ones that were about game mechanics, rules, etc. and had no component involving or affecting personal finance (taxes, losses, etc.) So, IMHO, <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/57931/are-lottery-tickets-ever-a-wise-investment-provided-the-jackpot-is-large-enough"">the way this question was rephrased</a> has made it on-topic.</p>

2230,30110,,2,,-3,2227,,,0,,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>The decision to exclude these topics in the first place seems to have been arbitrary and was even then accompanied by a suggestion that such topics might do well having their own SE site, though today any attempt to start one might meet resistance questions like ""why can't that just be a subset of questions on Money.SE to the extent they're about finance, or on one of the game sites to the extent they're about rules of a particular game?""  Without the personal experience of having had a relevant question on this topic closed &amp; kept closed here, I might even be the one to ask such a thing.  </p>

<p>I would say that these sorts of questions are on-topic here, or at least not in the ""off-topic"" list. </p>

<p>in addition to the other questions and comments linked through it.  Also there's the help that includes this as explicitly off-topic:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Questions about accounting that are academic or have no bearing on personal finance</p>

<p>As regards your specific question on the (non-meta) site: You might say that your intent there is related to personal finance, and since you know what you were thinking you'd have more ""direct"" insight into that.  As the question is written, however, I think it reads like a straight accounting question  Hence my comment.  There are currently 2 other votes to close, so at least some others agreed.</p>

<p>In the even that it hits the number necessary to close, you can still edit it to give it a personal finance element.  You could also preemptively edit it now to try to avoid closure.</p>

<p>Even if it doesn't get closed, by the way, I stand by the other part of my comment that I don't think you're going to get the help that you need on this site.  Your question really requires too much background on, well, accounting to be answered properly.</p>

<p>Also, keep in mind that I don't think it's a bad question.  It's just not a question that's well suited (in my opinion) to the format of this site.</p>

2234,12894,,2,,2,2227,,,3,,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I think that questions about how lotteries work (And similarly, questions about how games of chance work etc.) should be off-topic for this site.  They're not questions related in a meaningful way to personal finance, and would be better suited in their own site (which I think has been attempted a few times?).</p>

<p>I think the second lottery question - is a lottery ever a good investment - was a reasonable one for this site, but quite on the edge.  I don't think I'd welcome a question about ""is a slot machine ever a good investment"" or similar; I see the lottery question as slightly different only because people <em>do</em> believe it is a good investment (and, as Eric et al showed, it is from a point of view).  </p>

<p>I don't think it has anything to do with math (there's nothing wrong with questions requiring math here, in my book); it has to do with its relevance to personal finance.  Nobody goes to the casino thinking it's a good strategy to invest their money (aside from professional poker players, I suppose, and then it's a job).  But anything about lottery mechanics/etc. would fall in the gambling bucket for me.  (Then again, some of the questions we have about currency speculation...)</p>

2235,12894,-1,2,,2,2231,,,0,,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I'm not sure I would comment on the on/off topic nature of startup questions generally, but I would say that the question as you described would not be a good StackExchange question regardless.  Questions designed to elicit discussion are the exact opposite of what a good question is; they should be questions that have a single answer, and are reasonably narrow in scope.  We also discourage ""list"" questions.  ""What's a good XYZ"" is usually a bad question.  See the <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/help"">help center</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Now, I think that if you were to ask a narrowly focused question on that subject, it's possible, and it probably would get within range of being on-topic here if asked correctly.  But it would have to be narrowly focused, not just ""I need some ideas"", which is what your question reads like now.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'm thinking of semi-retiring, and going into business for myself.  I'm going to come up with an idea that will involve international travelling, offering some sort of personal service.  How do I need to prepare my finances for this?</p>

<p>What's explicitly off-topic is questions that aren't related to personal finances. I agree, and assume that's uncontroversial.</p>

<p>Accounting practices and principles overlap significantly with personal finance book-keeping. Balancing a cheque book, keeping multiple bank accounts, maintaining a sole proprietor business with one's personal finances: they're all deeply entwined with accounting practices and principles.</p>

<p>So it can't be the case that “accounting is off-topic for this site”; personal finance questions will frequently entail questions about accounting. 
I would say “if it's not about personal finances it's off-topic” is the clear, if not razor-sharp, line. Whether the question entails “accounting” or not, should be orthogonal to that.</p>

As such, we can now restart the Community Promotion Ads for 2016!</p>

<p>Keep in mind, we have updated some of the guidelines compared to previously - the changes are marked in bold in the Image Requirements section.</p>

<h3>What are Community Promotion Ads?</h3>

<p>Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.</p>

<h3>Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?</h3>

<p>This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:</p>

<ul>
<li>the site's twitter account</li>
<li>financial blogs and websites</li>
<li>cool events or conferences</li>
<li>anything else your community would genuinely be interested in</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal is for future visitors to find out about <em>the stuff your community deems important</em>. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are <em>relevant to your own community's interests</em>, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. </p>

<h3>Why do we reset the ads every year?</h3>

<p>Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.</p>

<p>The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>

<p>The answers you post to this question <em>must</em> conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. </p>

<p>Please <strong>do not add anything else to the body of the post</strong>. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.</p></li>
<li><p>The question must always be tagged with the magic <a href=""/questions/tagged/community-ads"" class=""post-tag moderator-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;community-ads&#39;"" rel=""tag"">community-ads</a> tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.</p></li>

<p>Given this post there is a comment saying:</p>

<p>""I am sorry to hear about your loss.""</p>

<p>I flagged it on the day being posted as not constructive (as I can't see in what way this will help any reader that gets to OP by google and reading the comment).</p>

<p>Today I noticed it got declined and the comment now is even highly upvoted (pushing useful comments even away as long you don't expand the list of comments.)</p>

<p>So I really can't see why my flag was inappropiate. I even see more informations given in comments like ""wow, great answer +1"" which are all over forbidden.</p>

<p>But here someone without knowledge about what's the correct answer gets at least an indication of views about its contents.</p>

<p>While I aggree this is not objective in contrast to the value of SE's voting systems, it anyway will still never be of less value than a comment like the one cited above. So what rule makes that comment valuable and even determined by upvotes highly usefull?</p>

<p>Additionally, with the comment voting feature, the comments didn't get clogged with 107 people all saying the same thing.  It only needed to be written once, and people could add their agreement without any additional clutter.</p>

<p>I would argue that ""I am sorry to hear about your loss"" is a more constructive comment than a simple ""wow, great answer +1,"" which is already implied by an upvote.  However, even a ""+1"" comment can serve a constructive purpose, putting a name to an otherwise anonymous upvote or putting an emphasis on a particular excerpt from the answer that the commenter thought was noteworthy. </p>

<p>This particular question got featured on the ""Hot Network Questions"" list, which means that it got more attention, more votes, more answers, and more comments than most questions.  But that's not a bad thing, and should not be discouraged.  Deleting that comment serves no purpose.</p>

<p>Other Stack Exchange sites (especially those that are profession-oriented) may have chosen to value information content at the expense of other concerns &mdash; because questions might tend primarily to be intellectual, academic, or professional challenges.</p>

<p>Here at <em>Money</em>, we value information content, too, but we <em>also</em> encourage civility, empathy, and sympathy because <strong>questions can arise from the personal crises of those asking.</strong> These kinds of questions are in a different class than <em>""How can I solve this tricky programming problem?""</em></p>

<p>While the death of a loved one or (say) a personal bankruptcy or a divorce/separation can have financial implications that create interesting questions to be asked here, such events can be life-changing and impactful for those asking.</p>

<p>Personal finance is <em>personal</em>, not abstract and theoretical, and so we may acknowledge a crisis the OP may be facing by using phrases like <em>""I'm sorry for your loss""</em> or <em>""That's unfortunate""</em>. This is especially the case when a commenter may have been through a similar crisis in their own past.</p>

  <p>Moderators really shouldn't be removing decent content simply because the OP doesn't want it anymore.</p>

<p>I would say that simply worrying about your rep is likely not a compelling reason for your post to be deleted.

<p>As described on both of those questions, you should contact StackExchange employees and/or site moderators if you want to have your post removed.  However, my advice is to not do this if you're just worried your question will lower your rep.  If you think your question is bad, edit it and make it better.  Over time, if you continue to post useful questions and answers, negative rep from that one question will not be major problem.  (As described on those questions, the main reason for deleting stuff that can't be deleted under normal site rules is if you post some sensitive information that needs to be removed to protect your privacy.)</p>

For example, a tax question is not consider ""complete"" here unless the jurisdiction is provided as a tag, even if the jurisdiction is specified in the text of the question.  I don't see that type of thing so much on other sites - People do edit tags, but they don't ever seem to be considered an essential element of the question itself.  For better or worse, that would seem to make this site more prone to retagging and whatever negatives go with it.

Many questions are, on the surface, questions about business, but ultimately are useful to someone who want to invest in a business.

<hr>

<p>Ultimately for me, the answer to this question is pretty much a ""no"", but keep reading anyways. The following are passages from the Bible (nasb version).</p>

<p>here is an excerpt from Deuteronomy 23:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You shall not charge interest to your countrymen: interest on money,
  food, or anything that may be loaned at interest. You may charge
  interest to a foreigner, but to your countrymen you shall not charge
  interest, so that the LORD your God may bless you in all that you
  undertake in the land which you are about to enter to possess.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From Exodus 22, it specifies ""to the poor among you"":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you lend money to My people, to the poor among you, you are not to
  act as a creditor to him; you shall not charge him interest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are also many quotes from the New Testament that encourage more kinds of ""selfless"" giving. For example, from Matthew:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Give to him who asks of you, and do not turn away from him who wants
  to borrow from you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Based on these passages I would suggest that you try to inform your kids about the rules of your loans. If they aren't paying them back because they have a habit of mismanaging their money, or are lazy, then perhaps you don't offer them any more money until they pay their first debt back.</p>

<p>But if their neediness isn't necessarily their fault, or they sincerely apologize, then perhaps you give them a loan.</p>

<p>Yet in either of these circumstances, it doesn't really make sense to charge interest on a new loan. In the first example, if you can't get your previous debt paid for, then just ""charging interest"" doesn't seem to help the situation.</p>

<p>But if there's anything to garner from this discussion, it's that generosity (and forgiveness) are important.</p>

<p>There are certainly SE communities where religious discussion is encouraged (see <a href=""https://christianity.stackexchange.com/"">Christianity.SE</a>), but it's not a great fit for Money.SE. Even the question to which you responded has been <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/63802/should-i-charge-my-children-interest-when-they-borrow-money/63817#63817"">closed as off-topic</a>, since it's asking for opinions and personal beliefs.</p>

<p><strong>What is wrong with answering a question in the comment section?</strong></p>

<p>Stack Exchange websites are sites focused on questions and answers.  They have a lot of community features that make them better than other types of sites:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Questions and answers can be edited (improved) later, either by the original poster or anyone else that has an improvement.</p></li>
<li><p>Questions and answers can be upvoted and downvoted by users, ensuring that the best information is at the top.</p></li>
<li><p>Users can ask questions about the answers, asking for clarification or refuting information, by leaving a comment for a specific answer.</p></li>
<li><p>Reputation can be earned for good posts, and lost for bad posts.</p></li>
<li><p>Answers are essentially permanent; they are generally only deleted by a moderator if they are not appropriate for the question.  Even after they are deleted, they are still visible on the site for high rep users and can be undeleted if necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>The person who asked the question can select the answer they thought was the most helpful and accept it.</p></li>
<li><p>When a new answer is posted, the question is bumped to the top of the front page, notifying everyone about the new answer and inviting community moderation.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Posting an answer in the comments breaks all of these features:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Comments cannot be edited by anyone, even the user who left the comment.</p></li>
<li><p>Comments cannot be downvoted and are sorted by post date, not by score.</p></li>
<li><p>Although you can leave a response for a commenter, comments are not truly threaded, and you can't leave a comment on a comment.</p></li>
<li><p>Reputation is not changed for good or bad comments.</p></li>
<li><p>Comments are intended to be temporary.  If there get to be too many comments, moderators will sometimes delete all the comments or move them to chat.  My understanding is that moderators have a ""Purge Comments"" button, which tells you how easy it is for comments to be deleted.</p></li>
<li><p>Comments cannot be accepted by the OP as the best answer.</p></li>
<li><p>New comments do not bump the question, which means that comments get less attention than new answers.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It can be tempting when you see a new question that doesn't have any comments yet to leave a one-sentence answer as the top comment.  That way, you get your opinion in early, your post will always be first at the top of the page, and you don't have to worry about anyone downvoting your ""answer.""  But that is not how this site is supposed to work, and doesn't leave your ""answer"" open to the community moderation features.</p>

<p><strong>Is it ever appropriate to leave an answer in the comments?</strong></p>

<p>Sometimes people think that a one-sentence answer is too short to be posted as an answer.  If you are saying so little in your answer that it is too short to be posted as an answer, you should ask yourself if there is any value in posting it at all.  If you are essentially leaving an opinion without providing any justification for that opinion, perhaps you should upvote a different answer instead of posting your own.  If you don't have time to post a better answer, then wait until you do have time.  On the other hand, perhaps the question is simple enough that a short answer is enough; if so, post it as an answer.</p>

<p>Occasionally, you might ask the question asker for clarification, and in the process stumble upon the answer in the comments.  At that point, you should write an answer and post it as an answer.  <a href=""https://music.stackexchange.com/q/12237/6851"">Here is an example</a> of a time that I did this on a different SE site.</p>

<p><strong>What if I'm not sure if my answer is correct, and I'm only speculating?</strong></p>

<p>If you aren't sure of your answer, it is even more critical that you post it as an answer, not a comment.  The reason is that you need to allow your possible answer (which may or may not be correct) to be moderated by the community.  Other users should be able to vote it up or down and to leave comments explaining why it is or is not correct.</p>

<p><strong>What if it is a link-only answer?</strong></p>

<p>The reason link-only answers are discouraged is that they have a tendency to become worthless when the link goes dead. Posting these as comments is no better than posting them as answers. In fact, it is worse; as an answer post, the link has the possibility of being edited in the future if necessary, but as a comment, it can never be edited. </p>

<p>Instead, feel free to post your link in an actual answer post, just be sure to include a summary of what the reader will find on the other side of the link that answers the question. </p>

<p>However, as I said in a comment to that question, asking for the ""why"" in any tax law can be an exercise in futility, because the primary purpose of any tax is to generate revenue, and nothing is ever completely fair.</p>

Answering questions in the comments is harmful for the site; it ends up with questions that go unanswered, and it ends up with people thinking the site should work more like a forum.  </p>

<p>A comment that gives the appearance of an answer but might be understood not to be sufficient for an answer... also should be deleted, if it's just answering the question and not clarifying the question.  Comments are for clarifying the question.</p>

<p>So, for example, here:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q.  How can I do my taxes online?</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>C.  The IRS has a page to help you out, www.doyourtaxesonline.com.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>That's an answer, and should be deleted.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q.  How can I do my taxes online?</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>C.  Have you seen www.doyourtaxesonline.com?</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>That's not helping clarify the question - it's more-or-less an answer.  Whack.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q.  How can I do my taxes online?</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>C.  Are you looking for something like www.doyourtaxesonline.com?</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>That's potentially clarifying, so it's fine - but I'd remove it once the clarification is received, and the comment poster has a chance to post it as an answer if that is indeed what they're looking for.  This is what I'd consider a 'borderline' case.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q.  How can I do my taxes online?</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>C.  What country are you in?</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>That's clearly a clarifying comment, and should stay until the clarification is received and then be subject to removal, as with any other now-irrelevant comment.</p>

<hr>

<p>I imagine the point is clear: I support keeping comments as clean as possible.  If they're clarifying something with the OP, they should be kept until that clarification is received.  If they're chatting, answering, maybe-answering, or anything else, they should be removed whenever a mod is around who feels like removing them (or moving them to chat if appropriate).  </p>

2307,12089,,2,,1,2298,,,3,,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>The incentive already exists to leave an answer rather than a comment. Comments can get upvotes but no points are awarded. Similarly comments cannot get downvotes. Would a downvoted comment have sufficient penalty if there are no points deducted?</p>

<p>Comments can be deleted without moderator attention if 3 (+ the number of upvotes) users flag them, that's lower than the threshold for close votes. The problem with an effort to enforce this rule is that unless multiple users are flagging comments all the time, this falls on the moderators. Unless there are enough users committed to policing comments, then we won't likely see progress here.</p>

<p>I agree with others who have mentioned that the line between a good answer and a helpful comment is pretty fuzzy, and I don't agree that comment answers are terribly harmful. I think a good answer with upvotes deters other answers more than a comment answer does. At least a comment answer can point a user in the right direction even if it doesn't take the time to fully explain why.</p>

<p>All that said, given the lower value of comments on stackexchange, deleting comments will probably hurt less feelings than deleting answers and closing questions.</p>

<p>Which another, new, member copied and posted as an answer. Another member flagged it to the mod's attention. Ganesh and I discussed it, and agreed that if the answer is simply a copied comment, it should have attribution to the comment author. If it's turned into an edited, expanded, comprehensive answer, attribution may not be as big a concern. Is this approach satisfactory? </p>

<hr>

<p>For sake of my 'answer', let's assume I agree, and start with No (as I agree with your concern). </p>

<p>The real question may be, ""How should we handle comments that are really answers?"" Right? Else, we simply agree with you, but have no consensus how to handle this.  </p>

<p>The option for a mod to ""convert to answer"" doesn't exist, we do not have that option as we do for ""answers that are really comments,"" that we just flip to a comment on the OP question. The implication here, is that a flag on such a comment is really a request to delete it. </p>

<p>Another option is that a member take the ball and run with it, copying the content, and hopefully adding a bit to it, to make it a good answer. </p>

<p>Third choice is for a further comment to prompt the OP to change it to an answer himself. This is what I typically do, and more often than not, it happens. </p>

<p>My concern is the gray area. One example offered in another answer was a link-only answer. That answer would be voted down as link-only, or converted to comment. But here, it seems that some would consider it too-good-for-comment. Which then will just lead to more discussion on something that I haven't seen as a major issue, yet. </p>

<p>Update - I wrote myself a macro for a comment reply for this issue - </p>

<blockquote>

I understand the thought that these might be considered spam by some; however, I didn't get that impression when I first read these three Banktivity questions.  They were asking legitimate questions, and there was no promotional link to the software.  They might not be the best questions this site has ever seen, but it doesn't hurt anyone to leave them open, and it may help other users of the software someday.</p>

<p>We have this page in our help section: <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/help/product-support"">Can I support my product on this site?</a>  On it, we explicitly invite product developers (presumably personal finance related software products) to come here and answer user questions about their product.

<p>To the comment regarding Washington question -
For the fact that WA has no income tax, does a Washington tag add value? Any state combo including a no-tax state would have the same result. I have no issue with state tags, I wouldn't delete any, I just don't see the widespread need. </p>

<p>Since adding a tag to a question would flood the screen and push new questions down, I'd strongly suggest adding to new questions as they are asked, and only editing old questions a few at a time. </p>

2318,10997,-1,2,,2,2315,,,3,,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>A couple of thoughts:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/124712/232449"">We can't create a tag without there being a question about it.</a> So until there is a question specific to <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/search?q=montana+is%3Aquestion"">Montana</a>, we can't create a <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/montana"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;montana&#39;"" rel=""tag"">montana</a> tag.</p></li>
<li><p>In my opinion, we should only use a state tag in questions that truly involve something unique to that state.  I think we need to be more picky about when to include the state tag then we are with including the <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/united-states"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;united-states&#39;"" rel=""tag"">united-states</a> tag.  The obvious use of the state tag is questions about the state income tax of a particular state, but there may be other types of questions that involve the uniqueness of a particular state.  A mere mention of the state by itself does not warrant the use of the state tag, in my opinion.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Taking an example from my home state of Wisconsin: I created the <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/wisconsin"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;wisconsin&#39;"" rel=""tag"">wisconsin</a> tag when <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/q/59047/10997"">this question</a> was asked.  The subject of the question is about a quirk of TurboTax's Wisconsin state income tax software and is totally unique to Wisconsin; the question should have the state tag.  Later, when <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/q/65842/10997"">this question (How do I decide where to register a car when I plan to move soon?)</a> was asked, I added the <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/wisconsin"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;wisconsin&#39;"" rel=""tag"">wisconsin</a> tag and also created the <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/minnesota"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;minnesota&#39;"" rel=""tag"">minnesota</a> tag.  In hindsight, I don't think this second question warrants any state tags: the question and answers could be about any state.</p>

<p>To be clear, the ""register a car"" question should indeed mention the states' names in the question text itself, because it <em>could</em> be important information.  But judging by the answers so far, it seems that it is not important information, and doesn't need the state tags.  If an answer appears in the future that reveals something unique about Wisconsin or Minnesota that makes a difference, perhaps the tags would be more important then and could be added at that time.</p>

<p>Adding state tags to old questions is okay, as long as the question (and answers) are really unique to the state.  Also, I agree with <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2315/state-tag-suggestion/2316#2316"">@JoeTaxpayer's answer</a> that old questions should only be edited a few at a time, so as not to flood the front page with old questions and push the current questions out.</p>

<p>The biggest problem with this FICO page, in my opinion, is that it generates more questions than it does answers.  It gives these vague categories and assigns percentages to them, but has no specifics on what you actually need to do to raise your score.  </p>

<p>I do like FICO's <a href=""http://www.myfico.com/CreditEducation/ImproveYourScore.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Improve Your Score</a> page, which does offer some genuinely helpful advice that goes against what so many people think is the right way to game the credit score.  I was surprised to see that FICO says this on that page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don't open a number of new credit cards that you don't need, just to increase your available credit.
  This approach could backfire and actually lower your credit scores.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Reduce the Amount of Debt You Owe – This is easier said than done, but reducing the amount that you owe is going to be a far more satisfying achievement than improving your credit score. The first thing you need to do is stop using your credit cards. Use your credit report to make a list of all of your accounts and then go online or check recent statements to determine how much you owe on each account and what interest rate they are charging you. Come up with a payment plan that puts most of your available budget for debt payments towards the highest interest cards first, while maintaining minimum payments on your other accounts. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's nice to see those on FICO's site, especially since we get so many questions and answers on this site from people that think they need to drag out their loans as long as possible and sign up for a bunch of extra credit cards to be successful.</p>

<p>If you want to be amazed, read a few threads on FICO's <a href=""http://ficoforums.myfico.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">message boards</a>, especially the <a href=""http://ficoforums.myfico.com/t5/Credit-Card-Approvals/bd-p/App_Approvals"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Credit Card Approvals section</a>.  You wouldn't believe how excited some people get about applying for credit cards.  They proudly show off how many cards they have, what their credit limit is, and their credit scores.  One user has 29 credit cards for a total of over $700k limit.  Even with all that, his score is not all that high (740).  Interesting.  I suppose it is no different than any other game people play, trying to get a high score.  But I don't know what purpose it serves to have that much available credit.</p>

<p>The system is not designed for moderators or Stack Exchange to delete incorrect answers.  The correct way to handle an incorrect answer is to downvote it, preferably with an explanation why.  If there is an existing explanatory comment (as there is in this case), you can upvote that one.  </p>

<p>Consider what you're saying.  Of people who have expressed an opinion on the question, a net fifteen have currently upvoted it.  But you want to reject this consensus.  Any governing system can make a wrong decision.  The Stack Exchange system at least allows for a decision to evolve if evidence shows it to be incorrect.  </p>

<p>Deletion is intended for things that are only pretending to be answers, not answers that are incorrect.  Example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>LULZ YOU GUYZ ALL WRONG</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is pretty clearly not what we mean by an answer.  So we delete it.  </p>

<p>This example shows why we don't delete incorrect answers.  It's still not clear who's right.  There is considerable disagreement in the chat and no citations to non-primary sources.  It may be that plans <em>can</em> restrict exit, but that none do so.  In which case this is a purely academic distinction.  It may be that the argument against the answer is based on an incorrect legal reading.  </p>

<p>There should be some citable example of a plan that has that kind of provision and has enforced it.  Or a citable example of a plan that tried to enforce such a provision and failed.  Two answers that disagree may be the correct thing for now until such proof can be generated.  </p>

<p>If you think that a moderator is abusing moderator powers, that is something that you can escalate to Stack Exchange.  It's not clear that you are claiming that moderator powers were used inappropriately (e.g. by deleting an opposing answer).  It looks like you are just saying that some of the chat comments were inappropriate.  That's just something to handle via the normal flagging system at worst.  And often it's easier to just move on.  </p>

<p>You should have more evidence for moderator abuse than just one event regardless.  They would be looking for a pattern of behavior, not a single instance.  </p>

<p>Firstly, I'm sorry you get that feeling from interacting on the site. I've also seen other people say similar things occasionally. It's obvious, but worth saying explicitly that no-one - whether a high-rep user, a moderator, or anyone else - has a monopoly on the truth, and this site should welcome conflicting views that are reasonably backed up and politely put.</p>

<p>I would also be a little careful about lumping classes of users together. Each individual contributor has their own style. In this question, you happen to have wound up in a position where the two highest reputation users on the site both think the same thing, but that's certainly not always the case. Either way, I think you can expect different users to approach conversations in different ways and I think it's best to look at what each is saying separately.</p>

<p>For myself as a fairly neutral observer (while a moderator, I don't have a high reputation nor any significant experience of the topic), it feels like both ""sides"" have reasonable points and it's worth continuing to dig for something more definitive.</p>

<p>I don't see the comment about ""if this were true, wouldn't we have seen it"" as an appeal to the authority of the person making the statement, but rather suggesting that there aren't any other examples of this happening, either on this site or elsewhere. While not having seen something happen is not a definitive proof that it can't happen, in the right circumstances it can at least be a strong indicator. Of course, the opposing point here is that these circumstances would actually be rare by their nature, so there might not be many other examples to find.</p>

  <p>The question here should be a straight question of fact. There's no real opinion involved - Either the law requires plan sponsors to allow participants to get out or it doesn't.

<p>I think voting does resolve this. In general, there maybe an answer that is 99% right all the time. There could be few exceptions that by and large don't matter and apply only to complex individual situations. Hence at times having a generic answer is right.</p>

<p>SE enforces that no one [moderator/high-rep user] can indulge in such things. Flagging etc ensure this is removed.</p>

<p>Regardless, many times people give incorrect answers. Many times they end up being the most upvoted. Sometimes it frustrates me because these are cases where people upvote what they <em>want</em> to be the truth and not what it really is. So this time it's my turn.</p>

2337,10997,-1,2,,3,2331,,,3,,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>There is misinformation everywhere on the internet, and our site is not immune.  Stack Exchange is written by people, and as a result, it is not perfect.  </p>

<p>Having said that, I think Stack Exchange, and our site in particular, has a lot of good features that make the information here more reliable than many other sites.  The voting system, the editing system, and the reputation system all work together to provide good answers to people and make the internet a better place.  But it is not perfect, and there are some incorrect answers on here from time to time.</p>

<hr>

<p>Here are a few examples from questions I have answered:</p>

<p>I recently ran <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/q/758/10997"">across this question from 2010</a> after a duplicate question was asked.  It only had one answer that was highly voted and accepted from that time.  However, in my opinion there were some problems with the answer, so I downvoted it and wrote a new answer, 6 years later.</p>

<p>Another example: <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/q/45134/10997"">This HSA question</a> was asked last year during tax season.  I wrote a good, convincing answer.  My answer was the only answer, and it got upvoted and accepted.  However, six months later, I had done some more reading and came to the conclusion that my initial answer was <em>completely incorrect</em>, unfortunately.  So I did the only thing I could do, which was to edit and rewrite my answer with the opposite position.  I pinged the OP to notify him of the change.  It is unfortunate that the question had a completely wrong answer for 6 months.  I wish that an expert had come along before then and downvoted my answer and offered the correct answer, so that the question hadn't sat with misinformation for so long, but that's the way it goes.</p>

<p>A final example, involving Littleadv and me, is <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/q/36818/10997"">this question</a>, on which I wrote one of my first answers on this site.  Littleadv also wrote an answer that is different than mine.  I came out on top with the voting on that one, but which answer is really correct?  It is hard to say.  We both cite sources supporting our positions.  In the end, hopefully the OP and anyone else reading that question can get some good information from both answers, and they would be best advised to seek professional advice.  (Unfortunately, some comment flags were thrown that day, too.  The mods did a nice job of cleaning up the mess, and I learned how to react (and not react) to comments.)</p>

<hr>

<p>Even a professional can get these things wrong, and sometimes there is no right answer.  Legal opinions are called ""opinions"" for a reason.  Two lawyers can read the same law and come up with two different interpretations for it, ultimately requiring a court to decide.  Whoever wins the court case is called ""correct,"" but that simply means that the court had the same opinion as the winning lawyer.</p>

<p>In the end, if you encounter an answer you believe is incorrect, vote it down, upvote a different answer (or offer your own correct answer), and move on with your life.  Despite its quirks, I believe that this site is a wonderful resource and provides a lot of help for people, and I'm happy to be a part of it.</p>

<p>Part of the system is that anyone can edit anything. So when I make a mistake, I expect to get a comment or suggested edit that makes the answer correct. </p>

<p>There were multiple things going on with this question. An issue that most members thought was an easy fact, and a voted up answer reflecting common wisdom. A single member providing the Black Swan disproving that 'fact'. Comments that got a bit heated as we tried to settle the issue and solicit facts. </p>

<p>As it stands, the initial answer remains voted +14 vs the 'correct' answer at +3. (And to be clear, the 'correct' answer warns of an issue that's not common, even the posting member implies this, as his evidence offers a different box choice checked)</p>

<p>A ""scam"" is when an individual is tricked into doing something that causes him to lose money.</p>

<p>""Fraud"" is deception by misrepresentation.  It is the broader term.</p>

<p>When someone obtains my credit card number (perhaps through hacking or skimming) and makes a charge, I have not been scammed.  I have not been tricked, and I had no participation in the matter.  But the thief has committed fraud by misrepresenting himself as me and making a fraudulent charge to my account.</p>

<p>We often get questions about scams. Some present a scenario and ask if it is a scam, and others are asking for the details on how a particular scam works.

<p>I agree with George and Joe that allowing the questions to be asked makes it possible to advise the poster about the dangers of a naive strategy. However, I think the inclination with some of these questions is for answerers to provide (incredibly subjective) opinions which run the risk of being seen as fact by the OP or a passer-by. An answer cannot be deleted for inaccuracy (only downvoted, which is less permanent and can be more easily compensated by upvotes). So perhaps deleting the question for requesting opinionated answers is the more tenable solution?</p>

<p>I simply don't see a way that such questions can be answered in a non-opinionated way, without writing textbooks worth of material. It seems to me that these questions would necessarily be too broad and too opinionated. Maybe a middle ground would be taking a solid answer which outlines the risk of such analysis, and consistently using it as a duplicate to redirect these questions towards?</p>

<p><strong>This depends very much on the specific focus of the question.</strong></p>

<p>If the question is seeking recommendations on which financial institutions will be least likely to be bothered by the fact that the person is an undocumented immigrant, that would very likely be considered <strong>off topic</strong> as a product recommendation (""which bank should I use?"").</p>

<p>If the question is seeking facts about a process, then the fact that the person that would be going through that process is an undocumented immigrant would likely be, at most, peripheral. For example, asking how a person in a given situation in the United States could establish their identity to a financial institution sufficiently to be allowed to open an account, is likely to be <strong>on topic</strong>.</p>

<p>This question although closed as economics, can equally be closed as Broad or Opinion based.</p>

<p>It's not just salaries, there are sites that provide a good guidance for what the average salary for an profession with x years of experience would be. This doesn't solve the issue.</p>

<p>Purchasing Power Parity is also know in quite a few currency pairs.</p>

<p>There are various aspects of lifestyle that are different. Hence comparison for like to like becomes difficult ... hence broad, and what to adjust to becomes opinion ...</p>

<p>A relevant example my friend in US had a Independent Bungalow in US. It was with Basement and attic, 2 levels of living space with 4 bedroom. He shifted to India and got a great salary compared to normal Indian salary. However this kind of house in India in Bangalore would be affordable only to CEO's of top companies. So is living in a 3 room apartment fine? There are multiple such aspects.</p>

<p>Drinking a Starbucks coffee couple of times a day is routine for quite a few in US. In India this would be considered luxury. </p>

<p>When I was in US, I couldn't afford a maid, driver or any help. In India I have 2 maids, a cooking maid and a driver. Plus I get plumber, electrician, window cleaner, and all the help without costing me much. Things that I absolutely can't dream in US.</p>

<p>Plus there is traffic, cleanliness, climate, culture, etc ... </p>

<p>All these aspects are very different.</p>

<p>PS:<br>
A research assistant in India is poorly paid, because colleges don't have funds. Research in fundamental science is quite low. Industry to university linkages are primitive and now where close to what we have in US.</p>

2363,7131,,1,,18,,890,4,6,,,What to do with X dollars?,<discussion>,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>Occasionally I see questions that are basically ""I have X money. What do I do with it"". A list could be compiled, but I feel it to not be necessary.</p>

<p>There are several ways to interpret these questions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want to outsource my investment decisions to Money@SE.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are several issues with this version. First, it's basically ""give me the codez"". Second, it is a useless question - how could you possibly trust strangers on the internet, with no stake, to manage your money, rep or not? Lastly, it is unlikely that a pro-bono roving investment adviser will take up residence at Money@SE and tirelessly provide every asker with efficient strategies tailored to their status.</p>

<p>More likely (and what I typically see happening) is that they elicit very vague and general answers, like ""look into index funds and bonds"". Because of space constraints, even basic advice ends up being too general to really work with, and OP would have to read up on it anyway before they can safely go and act on it.</p>

<p>Of course investment can be complicated, and while relevant to many, is rarely taught by schools or other mainstream information channels. For most people, it is neither interesting nor comprehensible, and they just want to get it over with and move on with their lives. I actually sympathize with this interpretation, but nevertheless it is not possible to provide what the asker is seeking on this site.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I bet there's one asset that performs way better than 99% of the others. I don't want to spend time and effort finding which one it is, so can you guys just tell me and I'll put all my money in it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course there is no ""best"" asset, it all depends. The only real answer to this question is it depends, it depends, it depends. Was it necessary for the question to be asked, to learn that it depends? Of course it does.</p>

<p>Again, I sympathize with this interpretation. There are now countless varieties of investment instruments, it's all quite confusing, and with most of them you seem to end up losing money. Surely there's one where you don't lose, and surely somebody knows which one? But of course the question is predicated on a false premise, so cannot be answered.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The amount of money at my disposal is unusual, such that typical investment advice (index, bonds, 5% in individual stocks, etc) doesn't apply. How should I invest?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trivially, very small sums such as $10 indeed cannot be invested according to standard investment strategies. Likewise, if we're talking hundreds of millions, this is also true, but in that case, you wouldn't be asking here.</p>

<p>Besides that, I feel like say from 10k to 10m, there isn't really all that much that varies in strategy. 30k? Buy the index. 300k? Buy the index. 3 million? Buy the index. Do we really need multiple questions, with only the number changing, and the answer is the same advice on index ETFs, bonds, CDs and so on?</p>

<p>As I said above, in some cases the amount is indeed unusual. However, it seems that most people who ask these questions have very normal capitals, and apparently overestimate how unusual their situation is.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Teach me basic investment principles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the only interpretation where the most likely kind of answer is actually what the asker wants. However, even so, it is impossible to give a good answer. Volumes have been written on this subject, indeed the asker would be far better served by reading those volumes. What can fit into an answer will gloss over so much that claims cannot be adequately explained and justified with evidence.</p>

<p>This is essentially a question that is too broad. However, it is also a very important question and deserves to be addressed on this site. The correct way of addressing it is to give OP a list of books to read on this topic, so they can come back and ask more specific questions.</p>

<hr>

<p>I feel that whenever this kind of question (""I have X money, where do I put it?"") comes up, what the person really means to ask is certainly one of the four possibilities I've listed above. Is this a correct assessment? What is to be done about such questions?</p>

<p>The recent <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/70330/making-100-000-usd-per-month-no-idea-what-to-do-with-it"">Making $100,000 USD per month, no idea what to do with it</a> struck me as a question that was sure to be closed as too broad. Instead, it's gotten 13 answers, with the top answer +110 scored. The answer, ""don't waste your time here"" explained why the OP should consult with a pro. Voting doesn't make a question on topic or even good, but, unfortunately, it's an indication of what members like. </p>

<p>What is to be done? More of the same. We close the clear duplicates. We close those that are truly too broad. We answer as best we can to set the OP on a path that should improve success. </p>

<hr>

<p>My remark on 'seek a pro' - This advice is fraught with its own risks. There are too many advisors who are dishonest. The good ones suffer for this. The fee-only is a fine idea, but the 1%+ advisors are not going to exceed the returns the low cost indexes will by enough to pay their own costs. Study after study shows fees being correlated (negatively, of course) with returns. The same inclination ""this is so much money, you can afford to hire a pro,"" I'd counter with ""this is so much money, you should make the time to learn to manage it yourself."" </p>

<p>My wife and are retired, and nearly all the stock portion of our retirement account is in VIIIX. The expense is .02% or $200/$1M per year. Tough to understand why anyone would happily pay $10K/$1M per year to manage their money. And it turns the 4% rule on its head, of the $40K you wish to withdraw, $10K is lost to fees? </p>

<p>By ""the index"" I assume you mean the S&amp;P500. While I'm a huge believer in index funds generally, I can't agree that one should put all their money in a single index. That would be a 100% allocation US stocks, a very risky portfolio for someone near retirement, for example. Generally a higher percentage of your money should be shifting from stocks to bonds as you near retirement. Also, ""buy the index"" puts one overweight in US large-cap. The Vanguard Mid-Cap ETF (VO) for example has risen an annual 10.4% over 10 years. There are index funds for US bonds, US mid-cap and small-cap, and international bonds, large-, mid- and small-cap too, as well as alternatives like commodities, energy, and utilities. 100% US stocks lacks healthy diversification.</p>

<p>I think there is a huge range of options between the two extremes of ""seek professional help"" and ""this is the best stock"".</p>

<p>Additionally, tools like <a href=""https://www.personalcapital.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Personal Capital</a> are invaluable in helping one better understand the implications of their current allocations and what changes one should make to match one's individual investment profile (age, retirement plan, risk tolerance, etc.). I can't recommend this free software enough! Here is a Personal Capital generated report which shows my current allocations and a target allocation for me, a 43-year-old single male seeking to retire at 65 with a Growth minded risk tolerance. It's a long term growth strategy with moderately lower volatility than your recommended ""all stock"" portfolio. The allocation is globally diversified and features all six major liquid asset classes.</p>

<p>There's nothing wrong with the opinions of a stranger. It's not a matter of trust. You either find their ideas valuable or you don't. Even a stranger would be doing you a great service by making the case for index funds over managed mutual funds or individual stocks, which I'll breakdown below.</p>

<p><strong>The Tyranny of Compounding Costs</strong>
This table breaks down an example of the impact of compounding -- and compounding costs -- over the long term. On the left it shows the growth on $1,000 invested by an individual at age 20 until her death at age 85, assuming 8 percent annual growth.</p>

<p>On the right, it shows what happens to that same $1,000 over the same period assuming a 2.5 percent annual cost, such as a mutual fund management fee. Over the 65 years, <strong>these annual fees eat up a staggering 79 percent</strong> of what the investor would have earned with no management costs.</p>

<p>Surely this is valuable information for someone who doesn't know what to do with their money and is considering paying a management fee to have a pro sort it out for them.</p>

2366,22881,,2,,2,2363,,,0,,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I agree that many times this site receives poorly constructed questions.  I think a lot of times questions come up when someone is looking to check a box without really understanding why they want to check the box.  A good example of this is the person the other day asking how to find an investment adviser.  That person really just needs a budget and probably to understand how his future paycheck will be taxed.  </p>

<p>When someone actually asks specifically for investment advice the question is generally closed as too opinion based.  To your point, ""you should have X% this or that"" is really never the right answer for the purposes of this site.  However, explaining aspects of a transaction like commissions, loads, expense ratios, mutual fund vs index fund vs etf, stock, etc are, I think, valid responses to questions relating to choosing an investment.  Showing the math of the way commissions, expense ratios, and loads vacuum up your gains does a lot to reinforce the idea that investment decisions should be scrutinized from a cost standpoint.  Holding on to your money does a lot to help it grow, and the focus of this site is your personal money.</p>

<p>This site isn't meant for CFA level allocation advice and analysis.  This site is meant for, this is how interest works, this is what an expense ratio is, this is how tax brackets work, this is why you want your emergency fund in a liquid account not an investment account, this is what liquid means, etc.</p>

<li>Payday lenders suggest it is responsible to use their lending services</li>
<li>The latest investment strategy implores people to ""beat the market""</li>

<p>Update - As I noted in a comment below, I feel that a change to the On-Topic should have more dialog when it's more than a simple clarification such as adding 'insurance', which was never in question, just not explicitly stated.

<p>The best-fit spot for a mention of technical analysis is in the first section&mdash;and yet we make no mention of trading, stocks, or any other kind of analysis. I think simply adding technical analysis would leave some obvious gaps.</p>

<p>My suggestion is to broaden the title of the section and add points as follows:</p>

<h3>Saving, Investing, &amp; Trading</h3>

<li>[... as above ...]</li>
<li>Securities trading and investing, whether long- or short-term, as practiced by retail traders and investors. (Excludes specific security recommendations, stock tips/discussion, forecasts.)</li>

<ul>
<li>Is ""welfare"" a sufficiently internationally understood word?  Is something like ""public aid"" a more generic term?</li>
<li>Is ""welfare"" too broad to be useful?  I wouldn't want this tag to include questions about Social Security, Medicare, education grants, tax incentives, etc.</li>
<li>Would a tag specifically about food programs be better?  If so, what should this be called?  ""Food Stamps""?  That term seems outdated, but I'm not sure what the generic term for these types of programs would be.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any thoughts?</p>

<hr>

<p>Update:
As @Dheer suggested below, I created the <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/welfare-benefits"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;welfare-benefits&#39;"" rel=""tag"">welfare-benefits</a> tag, with the following starter excerpt:</p>

  <p>Questions about government-sponsored need-based welfare benefits, also known as public aid. This includes questions about government nutrition assistance programs (food stamps), housing assistance, etc. This does not include mandatory government insurance programs, such as Social Security, Medicaid, unemployment insurance, universal health care, etc., which have their own tags.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I tried to make it clear that the tag is for government welfare programs and not private charity programs, and also tried to stress that the tag is not for government insurance programs.  If anybody wants to discuss the tag excerpt, feel free to do it here.</p>

<p>Tags are easy to create, perhaps too easy. There are now 25 pages of tags with 36 tags each. By the 16th set, usage is 7 or less. </p>

<p>Some of those will get used and become useful to finding similar questions. Others, such as this, not so much. </p>

<p>For the fact that this tag has no description, we don't know the intent of its creator. In a sense, it might answer the simple question ""I wonder what mistakes people make in their finances?"" But I strongly agree with you, a bad 401(k) to IRA transfer has little in common with the check that had one number written out and another number written as numerals. </p>

2383,3546,,2,,2,1885,,,3,,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>It's been a while, but I would argue that lots of questions on ""time sensitive"" topics can be worded in such a way as to remove the ambiguity in the first place.</p>

<p>Let's take JoeTaxpayer's example question,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is this year's IRA maximum?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>to which the answer can clearly change over time. By definition, this question is a moving target.</p>

<p>If we rather write (or edit) the question to be</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is the maximum IRA contribution for 2013?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>then</p>

<ol>
<li>The question is clearly about a specific year. <em>The answer isn't going to change later.</em> (In this case, assuming no retroactive legislative changes.) The only situation in which the answer could conceivably change would be if the correct answer changes from ""that has not been decided yet"" to ""that has been decided and is X"".</li>
<li><em>It is clear <strong>which</strong> year</em> the question is asking about. Someone who finds that question won't find out later that the answer applied to 2013, not 2016 or 2017. If someone wants the contribution maximum for 2017, they can ask a question about that, and even if the answer <em>happens to be</em> the same, the question won't be a duplicate of the 2013 one because it's asking for something else.</li>
</ol>

<p>Seems to me to be the best of both worlds.</p>

Should these types of questions be on-topic?  Are these types of questions different than other questions where a user is asking about personal values preferences?</p>

<p>Recently asked questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/q/72218/10997"">What are the alternatives to compound interest for a Muslim?</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/q/72217/10997"">Is there a sharia based 401k alternative?</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that I'm not only asking specifically about whether these two questions are good questions or not, but whether any question about Muslim finances is on-topic.</p>

2385,10997,-1,2,,31,2384,,,7,,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I understand the negative reaction to these questions, but I think that, in general, we should not disqualify personal finance questions from a Muslim viewpoint solely because it mentions Islam.</p>

<p>First, it is important to note that just because a question could be asked on another Stack Exchange site does not automatically disqualify it here.  The fact that these could be asked on <a href=""https://islam.stackexchange.com/"">Islam.SE</a> does not by itself require closure here.</p>

<p>Second, I think it is important to differentiate questions about Islam vs. questions about finance.  Our site is supposed to be a site for personal finance experts, not for Islam experts.  So when deciding whether a question is on- or off-topic, we should look at what kind of expertise is required for an answer.</p>

<p>Let's take the <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/q/72218/10997"">compound interest question</a>, for example.  Let's pretend that the question did not mention Islam, but instead said, ""For personal reasons, I don't want to participate in collecting interest from other people.  Is there an alternative investment I can make to take advantage of the power of compounding interest?""  Phrased that way, I believe it would be clearly on-topic.  As a result, I think that particular question should remain open under this criteria.  No expertise in Islam is required to answer this question.</p>

<p>For the <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/q/72217/10997"">Sharia-based 401k question</a>, the OP has a fundamental misunderstanding of what a 401(k) account is, and that makes answering this question as-is very problematic.  However, if the question was changed to ""I am a Muslim living in <em>[country]</em>; are there any tax-advantaged retirement accounts, similar to a 401(k), available to me?"", I would say it should remain open.</p>

<p>I don't think we should allow questions where we as answerers are required to tell people what their religion allows.  A question that only says ""I am a member of <em>[religion]</em>; am I allowed to invest in this?"" should be off-topic.  However, a question that says, ""As a member of <em>[religion]</em>, I won't accept profit from <em>[business practice]</em>; what is available to me?"" could remain open.</p>

<p>The mention of a religion or any personal value-based worldview should not automatically disqualify a question on our site.  </p>

2386,22881,22881,2,,-2,2384,,,6,,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I think they're off topic. </p>

<p>If someone came here to ask what someone could invest in if they believe in a cruelty free lifestyle we would all ask what exactly a cruelty free lifestyle means.  If you want an investment recommendation based on Shaira law then you need to qualify what Sharia law is (or any other religious law or guideline), just as you would need to qualify ""cruelty free.""  </p>

<p>The reason I think they're offtopic is because the answers are inherently opinion based recommendations even if the asker qualifies the religious or other restrictions.  This isn't explaining the difference between a Roth and Traditional IRA, this is making an actual investment recommendation based on some personal restriction criteria; and depending on the wording of the question, interpreting the asker's religion for them.  Additionally, it leads to inevitable and irrelevant arguments about what exactly cruelty free means, because you know, jets burn lots of fuel and contribute to global warming which is ruining the ecosystem in the polar ice caps etc... so I can't invest in a company if the CEO has ever seen a private jet.  If you're going to impose ethical restrictions on your life it's up to you to find solutions you're comfortable with.</p>

<p>With that said, I'm sure other people are asking or thinking about these questions because they're good questions and lots of people are Muslim.  I just think the answers are opinion based and we close loads of questions because the answers are or would be opinion based or product recommendations.  </p>

<p>I didn't vote to close either because I don't think the intent of the question is bad.  Both were asked by the same person, I think he's lost and wording his questions poorly because he doesn't know where to start.  I think too frequently we expect question askers to know the rules of the site.  I think if all it takes to make a question acceptable is a rewording then the question is good enough.</p>

2387,11604,,2,,9,2384,,,0,,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>To add to the given answers, and respond to some comments on the original sharia-investing question and this meta question:</p>

<p>From my perspective, what matters is what the central intent of the question is.  If the question is ""How can I invest in accordance with [insert religious/ethical/moral/whimsical restriction here]"", it is on topic as long as the restriction can be communicated clearly enough that answers can address it.  Even if the restriction is quite broad, if it is possible to give a good answer, we should leave the question open.</p>

<p>We have seen in the past that even seemingly broad questions like ""How to invest ethically"" can usefully be answered with pointers to ""socially responsible investing"" funds or the like.  Of course, such answers necessarily come with the qualification (explicit or implicit) that the questioner must use them as a starting point for research to see how well the options mentioned (e.g., SRI funds) match what he or she has in mind.</p>

<p>(Incidentally, in this regard I think questions about Islamic banking/investment are some of the least objectionable, because there are many investment vehicles specifically designed to meet that criteria.  It's much easier to answer a ""broad"" question about Islamic investment than to answer a ""specific"" question like ""What investments will help save the Devil's Hole pupfish"".)</p>

<p>To my mind, where questions would cross the line is if they are about the nature of the restriction itself, rather than about how to invest in accordance with it.  For instance, a question like ""Are REITs compatible with sharia investing"" would probably not be on-topic.  Such a question is not asking how to invest, it is asking about details of sharia.</p>

<p>More generally, this site is not just for open-and-shut factual questions like ""What is the IRA contribution limit"".  A vast number of questions here require answers that are opinion-based, because, for many issues in personal finance, there is genuine debate and idifference of opinion.  This is different from other StackExchange sites like StackOverflow, but that's not a bad thing.  Rather than closing <em>questions</em> because they might be answered in a misleading way, we should try to develop a culture of careful <em>answers</em> -- that is, answers which, when necessary, rely on opinions, but distinguish those opinions from facts and, as much as possible, back them up with reputable sources to make clear that the opinions have some currency in the wider world beyond the mind of the individual answering.</p>

<p>Or, in  short: a question may have zero right answers, one right answer, or many right answers.  But every question has many wrong answers.  We should only close questions that have zero right answers.  We should keep questions that have many right answers, along with those that have one right answer.  It doesn't matter how many possible wrong answers there are; that needs to be handled by downvoting (and if necessary deleting) incorrect <em>answers</em>, not by closing <em>questions</em>.</p>

2388,1113,,2,,6,2384,,,4,,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>Agree at broad level with Ben. Although the request is for generic discussion, if I take a look at the 2 specific questions, one was on topic, and if we see the up votes, they reflect overall 25 that is quite high for a question on this site.</p>

<p>This question to me is <strong><em>no different</em></strong> from asking ""<em>I want to invest only in Ethical companies</em>"". The definition of ethical is no tobacco, alcohol, etc. For some it could also be some other criteria of corporate governance. Of late there is also a trend of ""<em>wanting to invest in Green Companies</em>"". At times these are personal belief's at times it could be a strategy where by one thinks such companies would do better in long term.</p>

The existence of the country tag alone is a recognition of the differing laws and regulations supporting any question or answer. Often enough, some questions get closed as ""off topic"" because the wording of the question encroached on law.</p>

<p>Questions that remain open frequently have disclaimers from people saying they aren't a lawyer, or simply reminding someone to go find a lawyer without answering, or answering with hearsay and passively mentioning get a lawyer. This is coupled with the irony that the best answers here are advice, or answers that are accurate but not advice cause lots of discomfort. </p>

<p>Lawyers are a gamble. Having an educated opinion before even considering going to a lawyer has a lot of benefit. Lawyers are expensive and will often just Google the problem themselves, except for $500 an hour.</p>

<p>I asked a meta question about this topic last year: <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2124/should-questions-about-legal-matters-be-on-topic"">Should questions about legal matters be on-topic?</a>. My hope was that the question would help us draw the line between an appropriate and inappropriate legal question for our site. </p>

<p>My answer was that financial questions dealing with legal matters should continue to be on-topic. The exception would be for questions that are clearly about a legal dispute between two individuals, and I gave some reasons why I thought it would be a good idea to disallow these. </p>

<p>I think, for the most part, this is how the site has been operating, even if we don't have this rule explicitly in place.

2392,39757,39757,2,,0,2384,,,0,,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I think there is a distinction between ""Muslim finances"" and ""Sharia-compliant investment"". Not all people who describe themselves as Muslim accept the whole of Sharia law, any more than all who describe themselves as Jewish are orthodox or all who describe themselves as Christian are fundamentalists.</p>

<p>The basic criterion for a sharia-compliant financial product is that it has been approved by a accepted Islamic scholar as sharia-compliant. Such investment products are offered by mainstream financial institutions which are based outside of Islamic countries, and their use is not <em>restricted</em> to Muslims. See for example <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3035292.stm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3035292.stm</a>. As such, it seems just as valid to ask about them as about any other type of investment product. </p>

<p>On the other hand, relatively ""open ended"" opinion-based questions are a different matter. ""What is the alternative to compound interest"" for <em>one particular individual who self-identifies as a Muslim</em> is unknowable and unanswerable so far as SE is concerned, unless they explicitly mean only sharia-compliant alternatives.

2397,10997,-1,2,,1,2395,,,7,,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>I think part of the issue is that everyone has different ideas about what is on- or off-topic.  Yes, we all can read the <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">on-topic rules</a>, but applying these rules to individual questions is very subjective.  Some of us tend to be more open toward questions that are on the edge, and others of us like to close anything that approaches the edge.</p>

<p>I definitely fall into the camp of users who like to leave questions open.  It's not a secret; I've posted before that, when evaluating questions, I look for a reason to keep them open, rather than looking for a reason to close.  It is only when I can find no justification for them being open that I vote to close.</p>

<p>Looking at my own answers: Of my most recent 60 answers, 2 were on questions that were eventually closed as off-topic (<a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/q/73578/10997"">one</a>, <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/q/72423/10997"">two</a>).  A few others did collect a few close votes, but not enough to actually close the question.  For each of these questions, I can understand why someone would vote to close, and yet, in my opinion, they should remain open.  (If I didn't see these as on-topic, I certainly <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2150/10997"">wouldn't have answered</a>.)  I often issue a Vote-to-Reopen on questions after they are closed, but it is rare that a question gets five reopen votes after being closed.  It is just the way Stack Exchange works; the system, in my opinion, is biased toward closing questions and keeping them closed.</p>

<p>As for the motivations of people writing answers, I can only speak for myself. My initial motivation was to try to give something back for the answers that I had received from experts on other Stack Exchange sites.  The reasons I'm still here are to learn, to improve my writing, and to help people.  Competing for fake internet points, although it might be fun to increase a score, is not a great reason for being here.</p>

<p>I like seeing new questions that I can answer.  I think it is a shame when someone has a question, takes the time to post, and then the question gets a knee-jerk reaction of rude comments, downvotes, and closure votes.  I just don't understand this.  Our site is not overrun with questions, and it doesn't hurt anyone to leave interesting questions up.  I understand that question quality is important to the site, but look at the example you posted about median retirement savings: It's about how much people have saved for retirement.  Retirement savings are something that we cover every day here.  It's a clear, well-written question that has generated a bunch of interesting answers.  It has made the hot network questions list, and is bringing people to our site (also a good thing, in my opinion).  Why would we want to stop that?</p>

<p>As far as migration goes, I'm not personally a fan of widespread migration.  When a question gets closed as off-topic that should have remained open, it at least has a chance of getting reopened.  Once it is migrated, it is gone.  In addition, when a question gets migrated, the OP often loses control of the question, which means that no further info from the OP is possible.  Also, we are not necessarily great at knowing what will be well-received on another site.  Stack Exchange <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/285467/232449"">seems to agree</a> that migration is a controversial subject.  Instead, when I see a question that would be much better on another site, I like to comment and suggest to the OP that he moves his own question, allowing him or her to retain ownership.</p>

<p>In conclusion: When you see a high rep user answer a question that you think is off-topic, ask yourself: Could this question be considered on-topic?  Does it hurt the site to keep this question open?  The users that answered have already made the decision that yes, it should remain open.  You are allowed to disagree, but your opinion, like mine, only represents one person.  Vote, state your opinion, and move on.  Sometimes your opinion will ultimately win out, and sometimes not.</p>

<hr>

<p>To address your question: How do we discourage high-rep users from answering questions that are clearly off-topic?  I did my best to address it by asking the <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2149/10997"">meta question that you referenced</a>.  But, I'll be honest, when I see someone who answers and votes to close, usually my problem is less with their answer and more with their close vote.</p>

<p>As to your proposal to start mass deletion of questions that are closed as off-topic, I have to disagree.  Questions with positive score answers should not be deleted, in my opinion, unless there is a specific reason why a particular question needs to be deleted.  If you look at the help page for the <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/moderator-tools"">deletion privilege</a>, you'll see warnings against deleting questions that have good answers.  In fact, the more answers a question has, the harder the system makes it to delete.  This is all by design.  Closed questions are not supposed to be automatically deleted, unless there is absolutely no value (perhaps the question makes no sense, or it only has negative score answers).</p>

2398,187,-1,2,,2,2395,,,4,,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>EDIT - After the edit, in which Nathan added 11 examples of high-voted, closed questions, it might be time to reflect on the on-topic list. Not to expand it or cut it back, but to refine the wording for clarity. 
Keep in mind, we've already discussed the high voting, in an of itself, does not indicate on topic. After sifting through the comments, Nathan's point is that -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Questions about economics that are academic or have no bearing on
  personal finance</p>
</blockquote>

<p>with Chris' response -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was raised in reference to a mass media news article about
  retirement, a subject very much in the personal finance space, and not
  arising from, say, a research paper or dissertation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which prompts the need for some clarification. Are questions about data on-topic? I recall <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/14144/is-it-true-that-90-of-investors-lose-their-money"">Is it true that 90% of investors lose their money?</a> which appeared to be in a similar group, a member looking to understand a bit of data that didn't seem right. </p>

<p>Original text of my answer --
I think we are hitting a gray area. I can look at a list of questions and easily find the 80% I'd say are solid black, right on topic. But then there's gray. The question about how to join finances when married (for example). The OP needs a good shrink and pre-marriage counseling. Yet, the question is about personal finance, and I think ""will this help potential future visitors?"" Good chance it might. </p>

<p>The question discussed here is about a statistic, and one that's being misunderstood. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If indeed 5k is an accurate figure, how do 50% of old Americans
  survive in their old age? Do most old Americans rely on their children
  for financial support?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This might be on topic if only the numbers were accurate. If I were to post my own answer, which I'm not, I'd start by pointing out that one needs to look at data specific to pre-retirees. Even that might not offer the whole picture, but it would help. </p>

<p>The more I ponder this one, in particular, the more I agree with Nathan, that it's not really on topic, it's looking to discus a statistic. And regardless of the answers, it's not likely to be of use to future readers. </p>

<p>But, I take issue with our ""economics"" rejection. It's easy to check that box, but it implies something that's usually not true. It's not a candidate to migrate to Economics.SE. </p>

<p>To Nathan - I agree this question is off topic. But gray off topic, not clearly. If it were clearly, we'd have closed it by now. </p>

<p>Update 12/23 - The question was closed, then voted reopened. Which can mean a number of things:</p>

<ul>
<li>The question is off topic, but members don't care</li>
<li>The question is off topic, but not clearly so, and members interpret our current on topic list to include this type of question</li>
<li>The question is on topic, but not clearly so, and members are divided</li>
<li>(welcome to insert additional list item here)</li>
</ul>

<p>Either way, we have a situation where the question itself </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How do we discourage high-rep users from answering questions that are
  clearly off-topic?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>might be problematic. And given the lower rate of participation that meta sees, consensus may be difficult here. I hope to more input here, to at least feel like we have closure on this issue. </p>

<p>On this site we have few high rep users. Not even 1% of user base have 1000+ points. Unlike other SE sites, the users on first page on Money are quite well spaced out. So even if we assume there is gaming going on say 10% additional votes; this still does not change the user ranking. It is also to be noted that daily reputation is capped at 200 points. <em>So a few answers with large up-votes don't result in equal number of reputation</em>.</p>

  <p>What is the median retirement savings in the United States today?</p>

<p>This to me is was more of curiosity question and hence should have got closed. Although I don't know; but others may have read it as ""If USD 5000 is sufficient, I am fool to save more? This doesn't sound right? How much should I really save?""</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How can Americans get a chip-and-pin credit card for use while abroad?</p>

<p>This to be would have been on topic, as it is not asking for a specific recommendation, but what to do in such situation? now it is irrelevant.</p>

<p>Similarly for the next set of questions 1,3,5,6,7,10,11 were asked around 2011-12 and got closed later around 2013-205. Again some I still see as on-topic, it goes back to how you read the question ... this is where the voting comes in ... </p>

<p>We have closed quite a few high rep questions. So yes the voting works well.</p>

<p>I was taking a look at overall statistics few months back. We close around 30% of question as off-topic. This in my view is quite high. This could be because what we think on-topic is very different from the view of OP's on this group. </p>

<p>The fact that a question <em>could</em> be on-topic for another Stack Exchange site does not automatically mean that it must be closed here.

<p>In the case of the example question, perhaps the OP was not looking simply for a dictionary definition, but whether a term is actually used in personal finance, and therefore wanted the perspective of personal finance experts.

<p>In this case the last two sentences save it for me. It's not really asking what the median is: it's asking how people expect to retire with so little.

<p>This is not only difficult. There are too many countries, and there is no single expert. So it is more likely that there can be multiple answers. There was similar question in past and you can see the kind of answers it has got; its got answers only for few geographies. <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/5450/how-to-correct-a-mistake-made-when-writing-a-check"">How to correct a mistake made when writing a check?</a>.

<p>You could. Quite a few questions in past have a tag for one country, and in the body make a request for few more specific countries.

Had your bio not indicated a location, I would have posted a comment requesting information about your jurisdiction, as it is pertinent to your question. Whether or not you can cash a check [called ""cheque"", <em>where I come from</em>] is based on laws and banking regulations &mdash; and those most certainly vary by jurisdiction [like the spelling].</p>

<p>It has been our practice to permit and encourage variations of questions by jurisdiction, when jurisdiction is a key concern, rather than attempt to answer a question for all countries in one page. (Consider if we didn't: should a U.S. answer to a question be voted to the top, over the Canadian, U.K., or Indian answer to the same question? Which gets ""accepted""? etc.)</p>

<p>When a question touches on law, regulation, taxation, state pension plans, etc. then a jurisdiction should be specified. Notwithstanding, there <em>are</em> classes of questions which do not require a country tag (perhaps, e.g. household budgeting, debt reduction, etc.)</p>

<p>We have been using country tags here since day one. When I founded the site, I desired to promote international participation. As a Canadian, I felt that country tags would help avoid both (1) ambiguity, and (2) a <em>""U.S.-by-default""</em> first impression that visitors might have otherwise had if it wasn't clear the site welcomes questions from anywhere. An earlier incarnation of the site even had little flag icons on the major country tags, and you could often tell from a glance at the home page that users came from all over.</p>

<p>The country tags also let users who are interested in or expert on a particular country highlight questions of interest, and filter out those they aren't knowledgeable about.</p>

<p>Finally, the tags are also great for search engines. I imagine that people outside of the United States would tend to include the name of their country when they're interested in searching for information about local laws, taxes, and regulations. That's what I do, lest I get IRS results on capital gains taxes instead of those from the CRA.</p>

2412,10997,-1,2,,2,2411,,,0,,,,,CC BY-SA 3.0,"<p>Here is how I like to handle those questions.  If I am quite sure that the answer is ""no, it doesn't exist,"" I'll do some searching to see if I'm mistaken.  Then I'll wait a while, to see if someone else knows of an example that I'm not aware of.  After some time passes with no examples, and I am still sure that it doesn't exist, I have posted a ""no"" on these types of questions before.  (Here is <a href=""https://sports.stackexchange.com/q/15182/1723"">a recent example on Sports.SE</a>.)  For this to be a good answer, however, besides the ""no, doesn't exist,"" the answer should include some sort of explanation: a justification or reason why it doesn't/can't exist.</p>

<p>That having been said, if the subject matter is something I am not very familiar with, I won't post a ""doesn't exist"" answer simply because I couldn't find it in a Google search.  There are lots of things that are difficult to find on Google.  I'll let someone with much more expertise answer that one.</p>

<p>In my opinion, if no one wants to stick their neck out and say that it doesn't exist, there is nothing wrong with leaving the question unanswered.  In fact, this is probably better than having a short ""doesn't exist"" answer with no further explanation.  Anyone reading the question in the future and seeing that there is no answer will reasonably conclude that perhaps it doesn't exist.</p>

<p>Either way, as long as the question stays open, if someone comes along in the future with a good example (new things are created all the time), they will be able to post an answer.  For this reason, I think it is a mistake to close questions like this just because it is believed that the answer is ""No.""  If we answer the question as ""no"" and close it, it cannot be updated in the future if things change, and can become bad information on our site.</p>

<p>In this discussion, I also think it is important to differentiate between an on-topic question of this sort and a product or service recommendation question, which is off-topic  (see <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2207/10997"">this meta question for discussion</a>).

One of my favorite was: <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/58536/how-are-stock-buybacks-not-considered-insider-trading/58538#58538"">How are stock buybacks not considered insider trading?</a> Obviously the down-voters disagreed with my answer, but I think it was a reasonable viewpoint to add to the discussion.</p>

<p>I think it's okay to let the questions languish or close them if they are not suited to the QA format. I also think it's okay to take the initiative even if you can't prove the non-existence of something. Maybe by ignoring them we leave the site with worse statistics than if we answered or closed them all, but I'm not too worried about the health of our site.</p>

<h3>What are Community Promotion Ads?</h3>

<p>Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.</p>

<h3>Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?</h3>

<p>This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:</p>

<ul>
<li>the site's twitter account</li>
<li>financial blogs and websites</li>
<li>cool events or conferences</li>
<li>anything else your community would genuinely be interested in</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal is for future visitors to find out about <em>the stuff your community deems important</em>. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are <em>relevant to your own community's interests</em>, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. </p>

<h3>Why do we reset the ads every year?</h3>

<p>Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.</p>

<p>The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>

<p>The answers you post to this question <em>must</em> conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>All answers should be in the exact form of:</p>

<pre><code>[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]

   [1]: http://image-url
   [2]: http://clickthrough-url 
</code></pre>

<p>Please <strong>do not add anything else to the body of the post</strong>. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.</p></li>
<li><p>The question must always be tagged with the magic <a href=""/questions/tagged/community-ads"" class=""post-tag moderator-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;community-ads&#39;"" rel=""tag"">community-ads</a> tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Image requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li>The image that you create must be 300 x 250 pixels, or double that if high DPI.</li>
<li>Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)</li>
<li>Must be GIF or PNG</li>
<li>No animated GIFs</li>
<li>Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB</li>
<li>If the background of the image is white or partially white, there must be a 1px border (2px if high DPI) surrounding it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Score Threshold</h3>

<p>There is a <strong>minimum score threshold</strong> an answer must meet (currently <strong>6</strong>) before it will be shown on the main site.</p>

<p>You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/2425"">here</a>.</p>

<p>I agree that we do need a tag for it, because (at least in the US) vehicle title is something that often comes up on its own merits in financial activities, between title loans and vehicle sales, both of which are commonly done by individuals without any representation.  House titles perhaps should also get a tag, though usually those come in context of other things AND have a representative of some sort (lawyer or real estate agent) in the mix; if we did have a tag for that, I would suggest something appropriate as well that was more generic than <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/house-title"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;house-title&#39;"" rel=""tag"">house-title</a>, but I won't include those suggestions here to avoid muddling the voting.</p>

<p>Markets are markets.  Markets are just a culmination of many, many players and there will always be new paradigms, there will always be some market inefficiency for someone to profit from.  Different markets respond to different inputs in different ways and those responses will not be constant.  Different exchanges (BTC and otherwise) may batch order volumes in different ways and different traders attached to each exchange may have different strategies to responding to various order volumes.  These dynamics may or may not translate to the NYSE or IEX or any other exchange or security and will probably change over time.</p>

<p>The market is some other person or machine responding to market inputs.  Is a volume of 50k different than five orders for 10k?  Maybe, depending on the exchange it might be displayed the exact same way, and depending on every other market participant at the time the reaction may be different or the same.</p>

<p>Probably, yes.</p>

<p>You could improve the question by asking ""Does XYZ exchange batch all orders at a specified price and display them as a single volume?""  And we'd probably all vote to close because you should ask XYZ exchange.

<p>Personally I'd suggest focusing first on closing a question on this site if you think it doesn't fit - i.e. flag/vote to close. If you also really think that it would be a <em>good</em> question on another site, raise the custom flag as well. But don't do it just because you think another site is a better fit for the question. In this case according to your own assessment, just flagging to close would have been appropriate.</p>

<p>I think comments are somewhat specific to the topic at hand and don't necessarily agree that participation in another stack necessarily indicates a user's understanding of the rules sufficient to start commenting on every topic.  I think we get a lot of low participation comments for a couple of reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>The immediate points bump in excess of the comments threshold (but not the downvote threshold) for participation on other stacks

<ul>
<li>The fact that you can comment but not downvote leads relatively new users to comment negatively because they can't downvote</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The lack of a downvote feature for comments</li>
<li>The inability of a question or answer author to remove a comment that's been addressed</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm sure a lot of people thought a lot about the arrangement of this list.  I think that if there is a method for punishing bad answers, there needs to be a method for punishing bad comments.  And, I may speak for myself here, I'd rather get downvotes than a comments expressing the commenter's opinion rather than to suggest a specific improvement.  </p>

<p>A comment, by the stack exchange definition, is meant to address the author of the question or answer.  I almost think a solution is not a rep level required to leave a comment, but a rep level required to see a comment.  Either you wrote the question or answer and the comment is pertinent to what you wrote, or you're of sufficient rep to participate in moderating/editing questions and answers.  This obviously leaves the possibility that multiple comments with the same suggestion will be left but to some extent I think the fact that comments are public invites opinionated comments rather than useful ones, then the opinionated comments invite further comments and a discussion.  I think if comments were primarily invisible or visible only to those who could actually affect the edit suggested there would be no point to leaving a comment of opinion.</p>

<p>Ultimately if comments must be public, I think the core of the problem is that comments are ""free.""  There's no ""bad comment"" stick the way there's a ""bad question/answer"" stick, I'll never lose my precious rep points for continuously posting useless comments.</p>

<p>Second, as someone with the network-wide bonus privilege, I enjoy being able to comment on other sites where I don't have a lot of rep yet.  I'm not willing to give that up.</p>

<p>Spam is non-existent in the comments the way it is.  Almost all spammers have a rep level of ""1"", so this would be the case even if we lowered the threshold.</p>

<p>It is true that there are a few people that abuse the comment space.  But if we raise the comment rep requirement to 75 or 100, would this really stop them?

<p>Yes, I added the tag to several posts, as I saw that there were several questions about it and it seemed analogous to the <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/turbotax"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;turbotax&#39;"" rel=""tag"">turbotax</a> tag and the like.</p>

<p>For the referenced question in particular, I interpreted the question as confusion over why the form software calculated a value in a particular way. That is, I first read it as a question as much about the use of the software as about the tax form itself.</p>

<p>I agree with the general principle that software-specific tagging should be limited to questions about the use of particular software. This does lead to the problem (not unique to this site) that sometimes one doesn't know whether the issue is related to the software or not until after one has the question answered. That is, many questions can be ""Am I using the software wrong (clicking the wrong button for the thing I want), or are my inputs wrong (the software isn't really the issue at all), or is the software buggy (rare but not unheard of)?"" And it's hard to know which is the case ahead of time, so one might be inclined to tag it with the software specifically just in case it is a problem with the software itself.</p>

<p>I can see how once the answer is known, it can be helpful to remove tags that are superfluous, particularly if the tag isn't likely to help future people looking for the same issue. And this question was a borderline case, and perhaps it wasn't needed here. But I think that it could have been useful, and a reasonable thing to have done before the answer was known.</p>

<p>In my view it makes sense to keep them open as quite a few don't realize the variations of the scam techniques and are looking if a specific method is indeed scam.</p>

<p>The questions [and the answers as well] do attract quite a bit of upvotes which at times doesn't sound right. I guess from a stackexchange point of view, it is not what one feels as important question, but what the community feels is important. There are good number of great questions that have votes in single digits, and most scam questions/answers have vote in 3 digits ... so to an extent it looks incorrect, but I guess that is the nature of community who feel these questions are more relevant. </p>

<p>A link-only answer, with rare exception, is not considered 'good' and will usually be deleted. First, the writer will be invited to quote from the linked article, and if they respond, that will usually end it. </p>

<p>The deleted answer was not deleted as 'quote only' but for plagiarism. The OP was invited to edit the text down, but only did so after the answer was deleted, and now the answer is back. </p>

<p>Keep in mind, the question, as posted, was awful. ""What does X mean"" with no context or effort by the OP is almost always going to be put on hold. When a member invited the OP to clarify the background of a question, it's incumbent on the OP to answer, and in this case inappropriate for others to just say they like the question. As it stands now, I personally found the book citation and added it the question. If one were to visit, they now would find a well asked question, and an answer that has both a quote and a clarifying question. Also, I've removed the comments there, as they no longer apply.  </p>

<p>Last, not every question is read and scrutinized by a mod. Some of our activity is generated by members flagging, or looking at the vote queue. Other times, just regular reading. The first question you referenced which wasn't closed, quoted one run-on sentence as 90% of its content. Only now do I see that it copied a press release 100%. Not a great answer, but it was accepted by the question poser, you. </p>

<p>Note - I added more references within SE to offer other examples of the citation discussion. There will always be a grey area for these types of issues. I may personally look at an answer and feel that the quote was short and the OP's original thoughts sufficient, while another mod might delete for a bad mix (I'll try to refrain from using the word <em>plagiarism</em> as it's only a piece of the issue) </p>

<p>Financial information is of course a very broad subject. Some questions pertaining to this subject have been closed in the past several years, I have noticed. However, others remain open. The information asked about in <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/36560/where-can-i-download-all-stock-symbols-of-all-companies-currently-listed-and"">this</a> question is also liable to becoming obsolete, and it is certainly asking for a service, if information can be called a service. Thus, my first question here is how the line is drawn on questions asking for reference information help: what is a ""product or service recommendation"" that  ""tends to become obsolete quickly"" and what isn't? If this rule is construed to mean that the stack prohibits questions asking about paid services, that is one thing. But if the rule relates to any financial information, this brings me to another question. </p>

<p>Obtaining reliable information is one of the most important parts of investing. While it's true that databases can change, it's hard to see why this is reason for these questions to be disallowed entirely. Indeed, many of the most popular questions from this stack, closed or open, relate to questions about obtaining financial information, and they have tens of thousands of views. I'm wondering what the reasoning is here vis a vis finding a middle ground. Is there no way to allow new questions to come up that would update the old ones? As it is, the rules seem applied unevenly.</p>

<p>The site is evolving, initially few question that were answered remain open. However quite a few such questions are closed. Although the description ""Product or Service ..."" may not be quite accurate. The general consensuses evolved is more and more there is a debate of which specific website/bank/product/software is good. A golden rule book doesn't exist that says which website are universally good and which are paid social media promotions.</p>

<p>The wording is also quite important. If a methodology to find something is requested or the problem statement you are trying to solve; it may get a good answer along with few notable sites. However a point blank question; IPO site chances are it would tend to get closed.</p>

So far, after reading many topics and responses, many of the posters/commentors appear to 'expect' stuff like ""Detailed"" info.
I've been active at other forums helping out and many people take it like that.. general advice.
So far here, my initials comments elicited.. ""That didn't answer the question""! 
Yes it did, because it's a general response NOT actual professional tax advice.</p>

<p>Professional advice is not given online since peoples' Exact financial background is unknown and don't want to held responsible for said things as other commenters have stated above, but just some <em>general</em> information. 
Things can be blown out of proportion over time as I've seen at other online forums by unrealistic or obtuse posters/commenters. </p>

<p>For example, if I'm an engineer, I won't try to 'pretend' to know another matter like taxation. Tax laws have many 'exceptions' and it's easier Not to delve into the complexity of the subject which many people seem to do for general questions or pick on the subject. If you don't understand, then say so. It's very easy to misinterpret stuff online esp. on complex subjects like taxation.</p>

<p>""<em>We recommend that you seek a tax professional in your area to assist you</em>""... a typical response in <em>other</em> tax related online forums and many posters '<em>understand</em>' that and disclaimers are used at times by posters as a reminder including some reminders to be polite when replying.</p>

<p>The question is about applying and getting approved for a credit card.  This is a subject that is most certainly related to Personal Finance and is something we cover every day here.  (The <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/credit-card"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;credit-card&#39;"" rel=""tag"">credit-card</a> tag is our 6th most popular tag.)</p>

<p>There was some concern in the comments that this question would be unanswerable.  I believe this question is very answerable, and I have done so.</p>

<p>I understand some negative reaction to the question, as there are people (myself included) who think it is unwise to acquire so many credit cards.  However, that doesn't make the question off-topic.</p>

<p>Remember, ""too localized"" is not a close reason, nor is ""I don't like this question.""  (That is what the downvote button is for.)  There are only five close reasons, and since this question is not off-topic, not too broad, not primarily opinion-based, not unclear, and not a duplicate, it should be reopened.</p>

<ul>
<li>In the U.S., HRA is Health Reimbursement Arrangement, an employer-funded benefit for medical expenses.</li>
<li>In India, HRA is House Rent Allowance, a component of an employee's salary to be used for housing.</li>
</ul>

<p>A couple of days ago, I created the <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hra"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;hra&#39;"" rel=""tag"">hra</a> tag for <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/q/87915/10997"">this question</a>.  After doing that, I remembered that HRA meant something different in India, so I created the <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/health-reimbursement-arrangement"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;health-reimbursement-arrangement&#39;"" rel=""tag"">health-reimbursement-arrangement</a> and <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/house-rent-allowance"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;house-rent-allowance&#39;"" rel=""tag"">house-rent-allowance</a> tags, and tagged a few questions with them.</p>

<p>After I did this, I had a couple of concerns:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/health-reimbursement-arrangement"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;health-reimbursement-arrangement&#39;"" rel=""tag"">health-reimbursement-arrangement</a> is a really long tagname.  Is that a problem?</li>
<li>When you go to the <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/tags"">tag search box</a> and type ""hra"", neither of the new tags comes up.  I was hoping that by putting the text ""HRA"" in the tag excerpt for both tags they would come up in a search, but no such luck.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these topics has <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/search?q=hra"">several questions</a> and deserves a tag, in my opinion.  So, my question is: What should we do for tags for these two topics?  Some options are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Keep the tags as I have them now, <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/health-reimbursement-arrangement"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;health-reimbursement-arrangement&#39;"" rel=""tag"">health-reimbursement-arrangement</a> and <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/house-rent-allowance"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;house-rent-allowance&#39;"" rel=""tag"">house-rent-allowance</a>.  Don't worry about the long tagnames or the tag search problems.</li>
<li>Add ""hra"" to each tag name, so they become <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hra-health-reimbursement-arrangement"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;hra-health-reimbursement-arrangement&#39;"" rel=""tag"">hra-health-reimbursement-arrangement</a> and <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hra-house-rent-allowance"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;hra-house-rent-allowance&#39;"" rel=""tag"">hra-house-rent-allowance</a>. This would fix the search problem, but would make the tag names even longer. </li>
<li>Use one tag for both, <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hra"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;hra&#39;"" rel=""tag"">hra</a>.  This is <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/q/325/10997"">what we decided to do with the HSA tag</a>, because there is an HSA in both the U.S. and Canada.

<p>When these “quick close” reasons exist, people tend to use them instead of providing a custom reason for a close vote. And you’ve turned this quick close reason into a “catch-all” reason. Close voters will choose this reason for anything at all that they don’t like, as it covers “some other subject.”  It doesn’t really teach the OP what is or is not on topic. We already have trouble with close voters choosing the “product or service recommendation” quick close reason for questions that do not ask for recommendations. </p>

<h3>What are Community Promotion Ads?</h3>

<p>Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.</p>

<h3>Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?</h3>

<p>This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:</p>

<ul>
<li>the site's twitter account</li>
<li>financial blogs and websites</li>
<li>cool events or conferences</li>
<li>anything else your community would genuinely be interested in</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal is for future visitors to find out about <em>the stuff your community deems important</em>. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are <em>relevant to your own community's interests</em>, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. </p>

<h3>Why do we reset the ads every year?</h3>

<p>Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.</p>

<p>The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>

<p>The answers you post to this question <em>must</em> conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>All answers should be in the exact form of:</p>

<pre><code>[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]

   [1]: http://image-url
   [2]: http://clickthrough-url 
</code></pre>

<p>Please <strong>do not add anything else to the body of the post</strong>. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.</p></li>
<li><p>The question must always be tagged with the magic <a href=""/questions/tagged/community-ads"" class=""post-tag moderator-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;community-ads&#39;"" rel=""tag"">community-ads</a> tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Image requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li>The image that you create must be 300 x 250 pixels, or double that if high DPI.</li>
<li>Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)</li>
<li>Must be GIF or PNG</li>
<li>No animated GIFs</li>
<li>Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB</li>
<li>If the background of the image is white or partially white, there must be a 1px border (2px if high DPI) surrounding it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Score Threshold</h3>

<p>There is a <strong>minimum score threshold</strong> an answer must meet (currently <strong>6</strong>) before it will be shown on the main site.</p>

<p>You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/2536"">here</a>.</p>

<p>I can understand protecting a question if it starts getting spam or terribly inappropriate or low quality answers.

<p>While they sound like they have some value, if you assume their premise, they're really not of any actual value - you never actually know that thing will happen (or, if you did, the rest of the market knows that also).  The answer is always ""invest in something that correlates to the [fact]"", but with a paragraph or two first of ""don't try to time the market"".</p>

<p>Can we either just close these (as asking for opinion?  or as duplicates of one of the various similar questions?), or perhaps consider encouraging the OP to instead alter the question, if they really want to know what investment correlates to a particular [fact], to that: so the question above for example would be reworded from:</p>

<p>""What's the difference between a Bitcoin Wallet and a Bitcoin
Exchange""</p>

<p>I want to invest a small amount of money in Bitcoin. Reading <a href=""https://www.investopedia.com/tech/how-to-buy-bitcoin/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a>, I discovered that one should create a Bitcoin Wallet before buying Bitcoins on a Bitcoin Exchange such as Coinbase or Kraken. I don't understand why I should do that, isn't enough to download the Coinbase app, for example? Also, the link says that </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While exchanges offer wallet capabilities to users, it’s not their
  primary business. Since wallets need to be kept safe and secure,
  exchanges do not encourage storing of Bitcoins for higher amounts or
  long periods of time. Hence, it is best to transfer your Bitcoins to a
  secure wallet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What's the reason for that? It seems very weird to me. If I buy stock options, no one would object to me keeping them invested for years. Then why can't I leave my investment on a Bitcoin Exchange for a long period? Do I risk that the Exchange goes bankrupt or something like that?</p>

There were a few reasonable comments on my answer, then a side-discussion popped up about dealers and ethics. I flagged those comments as no longer needed, but my flags were declined. Another moderator saw the conversation and moved it to chat (this was my desired outcome; fewer notifications on my cellphone app for an argument that didn't interest me).

2561,366,366,2,,5,2558,,,0,,,,,CC BY-SA 4.0,"<p>Comments are a pain in the neck to deal with as a moderator - as @JoeTaxpayer says, deleting one comment can leave others hanging so you need to check through the whole list anyway to make sure it still makes sense. We get an auto-flag when a post hits 20 comments and then we normally do move the conversation to chat. Sometimes a set of comments doesn't seem too bad in itself but as the volume mounts up the case for deleting the whole lot strengthens.</p>

<p>Personally I generally err on the side of deleting comments that <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/help/privileges/comment"">shouldn't be there</a>, and if I don't have time to look properly I'll leave the flag for me or another mod to handle later. But sometimes I'll dismiss a comment flag and then later change my mind. I might also dismiss a ""rude and abusive"" flag because I don't think the content meets that threshold (those flags also have some negative consequences for the comment poster) but then delete anyway on the grounds of ""no longer needed"".</p>

<p>So there's nothing really you could have done differently, it's just one of those grey areas where the result you get from a flag will depend on slightly random luck. Also, unfortunately the UI doesn't let us mark a comment flag helpful if we don't want to delete the comment, so you're more likely to have them marked as ""declined"". For flags on other content I mostly mark them as helpful even if I don't take action if I thought the flag was plausible.</p>

<p>I've come across <a href=""http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/82671/accounting"">links</a> to an Area51 proposal for an Accounting.SE community, but it would appear that the proposal was deleted several years ago. I'm not sure why this proposal was deleted - if it simply failed to gain enough traction, or if it was deleted for some other reason - but I suspect that &quot;accounting&quot; was too broad of a topic and intersected significantly with PFM.SE.</p>
<p><strong>I think it's time to try again.</strong></p>

<h3>On-topic questions would include:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Questions about basic <strong>business</strong> finance and accounting principles, such as one might discuss in a college-level business course;</li>
<li>Questions about the application of these principles in a professional setting;</li>
<li>Questions about <em>requirements</em> for accounting software systems.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Note that these questions are not really served by any other SE community:</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com"">Personal Finance and Money</a> only permits accounting questions related to <em>personal</em> finance;</li>
<li><a href=""https://quant.stackexchange.com/"">Quantitative Finance</a> appears to be more about quantitative macroeconomics, such as the modeling of financial markets, as well as securities trading algorithms. Accounting questions are largely ignored and <a href=""https://quant.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">may not even be on-topic</a>.</li>
<li><a href=""https://dba.stackexchange.com"">Database Administrators</a> is useful for asking how to <em>implement</em> accounting systems, but cannot really answer questions about the underlying accounting principles.</li>
<li><a href=""https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com"">Software Engineering</a> seems to be the best fit for an <a href=""https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/221156/should-a-dr-cr-entry-both-be-created-or-a-single-entry-accounting-is-fine"">accounting question</a> at the moment, and not a very good one.

<h3>Off-topic questions would include:</h3>

<p><sup><em>(my emphasis)</em></sup></p>
<p>You get points by asking questions <strong>or answering</strong> them<sup><strong>1</strong></sup>. If you've got something to share, you can – and are actively encouraged – to do so. <em>But</em> that sharing should focus on questions and answers, not comments.</p>
<p>What you have to remember (or realise) about the StackExchange sites is that unlike many other websites, they aren't &quot;forums&quot; or &quot;message boards&quot; where someone posts something (hopefully) interesting and all-and-sundry chip in with their views. Instead, its &quot;heart and sole&quot; is to be a collection of questions and answers that <strong>(a)</strong> hopefully help the original asker, but <strong>(b)</strong> almost more importantly will help others in the future.</p>
<p>Personally, I'm not sure whether 50 is the <em>right</em> limit, but – as I understand it – one of the main reasons for their <em>being a limit</em> is to stop new users arriving here in &quot;message-board mode&quot; and flooding questions with comments. Once they've been here a bit and &quot;learnt the ropes&quot;, then they get the ability to comment.</p>
<p>The two main downsides to the limit is that <strong>(a)</strong> some people are dissuaded from hanging around long-enough to get the initial 50 points (although it's not too onerous a task), and <strong>(b)</strong> people post comments as answers (and then get even more dissuaded because of the backlash that follows).</p>
<hr/>
<p><sup><strong>1</strong></sup> There are other ways to earn points, such as by editing, but asking and answering are probably the main ones.</p>

If the question should be migrated, that's a choice as well. There's also the ""other"", which is a fill-in-the-blank choice that others can agree with. For now, the 3 fixed choices are what we have.

Despite the fact that the help center confirm this use of <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/flag-posts"">Flags</a>, I'd discourage it. A flag is set to draw the attention of a moderator. Voting to close is best done by members, not mods. Flags imply a level of urgency, and should be used sparingly. When I see a flag to close that has no current votes, I'm more likely to avoid the close, as it seems heavy handed to other members, creating the appearance of the mods going overboard with the god-hammer. And by ignoring the flags, the member trying to offer his participation might feel ignored or slighted. It becomes a no-win. On the other hand, I see this OP has earned rep by editing. Good edits are always welcome. </p>

<p>However, all your flag does is put the question in a queue for review by high rep users, and the reason you select does not get seen by the public.  If you don't see a reason that fits, you can select ""Blatantly off-topic,"" or you can just decide not to flag.

This new newb banner is stupid, and the discussion around it in the main meta section has more or less soured me on this entire platform.  If there is some expected user attrition in the apparent quest to entice more question askers then I suppose I'll be one example.</p>

<hr>

<p>I'm aware that this is wildly off topic for the meta and I apologize for the length but here it is: I started contributing here because I do have an education in finance and some experience in financial industries.  I don't get everything right all the time and I have certainly gleaned some great ideas from other users and hope that I've been able to help people make good financial decisions. </p>

<p>I've complained about comments before, and have since flagged a lot of them.  </p>

<p>The issue I have applying this format to this topic is that answers to questions that are not not directly related to the definition of a word or something very specific like ""given these terms how much interest do I pay in the first year?"" have an opinion component.  ""Should I pay the highest balance or highest interest rate first?""</p>

<p>The comments here are never, ""hey you misspelled that word."" Comments tend to be ""why would you do that?  That's terrible advice, you should ALWAYS pay the highest rate.""   Largely, I'm ok clarifying my stance, my gripe comes from the users we have who seem to only comment.  Comments here tend to detract from answers because they'll address a perceived opinion with a divergent opinion and are almost never accompanied by an answer from the user.  There is a contingent of users who tend to post psudo-answers to questions and make no honest attempts to improve anything.   </p>

<p>To the stupid <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/314287/come-take-a-look-at-our-new-contributor-indicator/"">new contributor banner</a> and the reason I started this thread.</p>

<p>The very first item in what can I do is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Flag comments</strong> that are unfriendly or simply unhelpful. New users can do this now on posts that they own, but let's show people that we're serious about investing as much in them as they do in us. Snark sets a bad impression, <strong>but snark vanishing quickly sets a much better one</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Punishing</strong> snark might actually curb it.  The problem this platform has is comments.  Bad answers (and, really, perfectly fine answers that people disagree with) are downvoted.  Users are rewarded for good questions and answers and dinged for bad ones.  Bad comments get to exist.  In fact, the construct that exists to punish bad answers gives incentive to for people to post a bad comment pseudo-answers instead.  </p>

<p>I've seen my own comments be deleted so I know there's some amount of moderation but there is absolutely no transparent, direct structure to curb improper use of comments. And, to my knowledge I've never been punished for my deleted comments.</p>

  <p>Fill in member name - We are trying to enforce ""too good to be a

  to the question. See the meta question <a href=""http://meta.money.stackexchange.com/questions/2298/should-answers-be-left-in-the-comments"">Should answers be left in the

<p>This post is put up to share the above and to also try to move the bar on how we handle comments moving forward. In my opinion, if we use the tour reason for comments e.g. ""Please add a country tag"", once the question (or answer) addresses the request, the comments can easily be deleted and no one should object. And should a comment thread go off into a long discussion, no one should be surprised if it suddenly vanishes. </p>

<p>I've written this as a statement. The questions to members - </p>

<p>From your perspective, do you object to the above? Or do you feel the above is not the intent of the 'comment' definition on SE? </p>

<p>For longer term members - Does this feel like a shift in behavior or enforcing something we've really had in place for some time? </p>

<p>I am hopeful we can see member response here, and ultimately, after some editing, use this as the link to the objection ""where did the comments just go?"" when asked. </p>

<p>Note: This question was partially prompted by the recent <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2592/how-would-i-go-about-deleting-my-account"">How would I go about deleting my account?</a> which really was a reaction to comments and the newbie badge. </p>

<p>Last, when I visited a mod-only chat room, the level of enforcement regarding comments was not really consistent. Each board tends to have its own personality. For what it's worth, my own view from the modding effort is that most behavior issues are contained within comments. Not all, but most. If you answer below, please be mindful of the distinction between the two issues ('answer in comment' vs 'general chatter') cited above. Addressing them has different reasons and results.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>As a new member to PF&amp;E, I don't object to your template. I particularly like the positive tone in the phrase ""too good to be a comment"". Such a comment from a mod is strong motivation to turn the comment into an answer.</p>

<p>As for the broader intent, I think that's consistent with the relevant <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/comment"">Help</a> pages:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Comments are temporary ""Post-It"" notes left on a question or answer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Each SE community develops its own culture. Compared to <a href=""https://english.stackexchange.com/"">EL&amp;U</a>, for example, there's a lower bar here in relation to external support for answers. This suits PF&amp;M as there's really not a whole lot of definitive material beyond the basics, with much relying on observations based on personal experience (e.g. <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/q/99561/75926"">leveraged ETFs vs S&amp;P500</a>, or <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/q/99097/75926"">buying an expensive car at 18</a>). Voting by the community is a sensible gauge of the worth of an answer.</p>

<p>This also reduces the 'penalty' fear for new members posting answers i.e. <em>What if they don't like my answer?</em> On the flip side, it could be pointed out that in the absence of comment down-votes, <em>flags</em> fill the role. And it sounds a lot more serious to get flagged than to get down-voted. Since the PF&amp;M community is happy to keep answers that are sensible even if not particularly well-supported by external links and a half-century of personal experience as a banker, there isn't really much reason to pick the comment box rather than the answer box when one has an answer to contribute.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, answering in comments can be a personal choice - someone might feel that they're not answering the whole question, or they might be tentative about their answer. Deleting the comment outright is consistent with the intent for comments in the Help pages, but that can come across as a little harsh if the comment is genuinely helpful. A middle-ground used to good effect at EL&amp;U is to create a <strong>wiki-answer</strong> - create a wiki answer (tick the ""community wiki"" checkbox below the answer box), quote and attribute the content of the comment, even link to the commenter's profile page, then delete the comment. Anyone who can create wikis (<a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/community-wiki"">just 10 rep required</a>) can participate in this, and then flag the comment for deletion. This keeps all the benefits of answer-box answers except rep movements through up- and down- votes but voting on comments doesn't influence rep anyway, so comment-to-wiki is all up-side and no down-side.</p>

2605,10997,,2,,9,2602,,,7,,,,,CC BY-SA 4.0,"<p>I agree that the comment space is often abused, and the worst offense, in my opinion, is the answer-in-a-comment, for <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2299/10997"">many reasons</a>.  I have tried a bunch of times leaving a reply for an answer-comment, explaining that answers should not be left in comments, but nearly every time I do, the offender gets defensive and argues, which just clutters the comment space even further.  It is very rare that a user posts a drive-by answer-comment, gets called on it, and then turns it into an actual answer post.  Why?  Because they aren't interested in really answering the question in the first place.  They just wanted to leave their snarky one-sentence answer (which they suspected would attract downvotes as an answer post) and they don't want to take the time to put any more effort into it.</p>

<p>The approach I'm currently favoring is this: Leave a comment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>@UserX: Please do not <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2298/10997"">answer the question in the comments area</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and immediately delete the answer-comment.  Once people realize that their drive-by answer comment doesn't last long, they will quit doing it.  Only a mod has the power to delete the answer-comment, but other users can flag the answer comment for deletion.</p>

<p>I've seen this approach used by supermod <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/users/825/robert-cartaino"">Robert Cartaino</a> more than once when he is modding sites during the early days of new sites.  He'll leave a warning response comment for the offender and immediately delete the answer-comment.  No discussion or debate.  People learn early on that it is not acceptable to leave an answer in the comments.</p>

I also think your ""too good to be a comment"" plug is a good one.</p>

<p>I haven't been here as long as many, but I have done a lot of lurking. One of the things I have liked about money.se compared to a lot of other stacks is the atmosphere here. It seems like there isn't as much bickering happening here, and, in my limited view, moderation has been pretty chill. I like that. If someone has an interesting comment to leave, even if it isn't suggesting improvements, it is generally left alone, which is awesome. One really annoying thing is when comments are zealously moderated to the point when a useful, but not strictly on topic, comment is removed before anyone gets a chance to see it.</p>

<p>Obviously long conversations in comment sections are annoying and should be sent to chat, click-baity and controversial posts like <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/99097/by-18-years-of-age-i-want-a-brand-new-car-thats-43-668/99133#99133"">the 17 year old who wants to buy an expensive car</a> will need extra comment vigilance, and answer-in-comments need to be discouraged more emphatically.

<p>First, not every question deserves a complete, well written and supported answer.  Asking whether someone in Nigeria who asks for bank account info is running a scam, for instance.  A simple comment seems sufficient.</p>

<p>Second, not every question can have an immediate answer.  There needs to be space for suggestions and discussion, and comments are the best and most accessible place for this.  You (the moderators) keep moving such discussions to /dev/null (AKA ""chat""), where they can't be seen (at least without considerable effort) or a discussion effectively continued.

2610,,187,2,,-1,2602,,,4,user75979,,,,CC BY-SA 4.0,"<p>I like the general ideas you are posting but I have to say some of them are kind of misguided in my view. The two big ones that stick out to me are:</p>

<p><strong>""Suggesting corrections that don't fundamentally change the meaning of the post; instead, make or suggest an edit;""</strong> </p>

<p>You don't really get the ability to edit until you reach a certain reputation. Why penalize a newcomer when they don't really have the choice anyway? If it is someone that has a high rep doing this absolutely enforce it. </p>

<p><strong>""Compliments which do not add new information (""+1, great answer!""); instead, up-vote it and pay it forward;""</strong></p>

<p>Again same problem from what I see the people saying +1 are usually the ones that don't have the ability to up vote. Also I don't see the harm in saying why you think that an answer is good or bad in the comment. If it is constructive, it does show other people what is good or bad about a particular answer, instead of just showing a score. </p>

<p>A lot of these problems are structural issues with the website itself. Why not add the ability to down vote a comment? or make chats more user friendly and available? Instead of having chats down in the trenches where no one sees them, or cares to use them. </p>

<p>My suggestion would be a chat button right on the answer itself where you can debate the particulars of something controversial. It should be easy to see that people have been chatting on it in the first place. More people would be inclined to use it if it was right there in front of them, or you could tell the difference when people have been using it or not. Like highlighting the chat button green when it has been used, and grey when it is empty. </p>

<p>The sample question strikes me as one that’s not particularly good. The links will break, and we’ll be left with “Why would two coins, of the same type, have such different list prices?” And the accepted answer would be some mix of “condition causes prices to be non-linear. A proof or mint pristine coin will sell for far more than an average coin” or “that high price was never fetched.” On reflection, such a Q&amp;A would work for any collectible. This could be for a comic book, stamp, baseball card, etc. </p>

<p>For what it’s worth, I frequently look to buy a used high school text book. A new one is ~ $150, and I’ll get most for $20-$40 with some patience. It’s common for me to find listings for $900+ and there is no reason that such a book would sell for that price, as these are not collectibles. </p>

<p>So to be clear, a well crafted question can easily be on-topic, or get closed quickly as off. </p>

<p>If I ran the world, these would either (A) not bump, and would not be even noticed, or (B) throttle, by either (B1) limiting members to X edits per day, or (B2) prioritizing, so edits on older posts don't go though at a rate of more than X per day.

2631,10579,,1,,1,,188,1,2,,,Personal Finance & Money updated site theme is ready for testing!,<discussion><design>,CC BY-SA 4.0,"<p>As part of implementing the new unified themes across the network, we're gradually rolling out updated site themes for each site. As of today, we have enabled your updated site theme for testing. </p>

<p>If you can't see it right now, that's by design! This is a very early test implementation of your design and we need your help finding issues with it before we make it live for everyone permanently. So, keep in mind, there will be things that need fixing! We'll address those things as we can.</p>

<p>If you'd like to review it, here's how:</p>

<h2>How do I enable it?</h2>

<p><a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/users/preferences"">Click here</a> and check the ""Beta test new themes"" option. This will turn on the new theme for all sites that have one in testing, including this one. <em>Here's <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/314542/opt-in-to-beta-testing-new-themes"">more info</a> on how to opt in.</em> You can uncheck the box to revert to the older theme until the site is live for everyone. <strong>Note, while turning it on is immediate, it will take a few minutes to revert to the old view - <em>but it will go through!</em></strong></p>

<h2>What type of feedback do we need?</h2>

<h3>On this post: Bugs related to this site's design elements</h3>

<p>Please help us look for issues/bugs related to the theme design and how we have mapped the old theme to the new. This needs to be done within the <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/307862/ch-ch-ch-changes-left-nav-responsive-design-themes"">limits of the new unified theme</a>.</p>

<p>This could include colors of sections of the design or text, problems with JavaScript add-ons (if applicable), the logo or top banner appearance or other artwork.</p>

<p>You can also feel free to ask questions about the new layout if you're unsure how to navigate it.</p>

<h3>On Meta Stack Exchange: General concerns about left nav or theming</h3>

<p>There are some things that are definitely changing everywhere and can't really be adjusted on a per-site basis. A few of them include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Top banner is shorter in height, so some artwork has to be adjusted along with some logos.</li>
<li>Left Navigation is active everywhere (but can be collapsed into a menu by visiting your site preferences - <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/311237/284336"">instructions here</a>).</li>
<li>Responsive layout is active, which lets the site adjust as browser widths change - no side scrolling (some pages haven't been updated, yet, though). For now, if you prefer the scrolling, you can disable this by clicking the ""disable responsiveness"" link in the footer.</li>
<li>Many site elements including tags and voting arrows are standardized across the network.</li>
<li>Link underlining is active. In an effort to make links more visible, they are now being underlined.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have concerns or issues regarding the left nav or the overall approach we are taking to theming, then <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/310908/live-left-nav-new-theming-and-responsiveness"">this Meta Stack Exchange post</a> is the right place for feedback. </p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, there are some unique design elements like voting arrows and tags that are being standardized in this process. Keeping these custom elements makes our ability to maintain the sites too complex and, while we're very sad to see them go, we're in a difficult position of needing to make the site designs work together so that we can continue to address feature requests and bugs that will make your Q&amp;A experience better. This is addressed in a <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/314799/why-we-initiated-the-latest-round-of-design-changes-and-the-role-of-meta"">Meta Stack Exchange post</a> if you want more detail.</p>

<h2>What new themes?</h2>

<p>If you're like, ""What the heck are you talking about?"", then you should read the Meta Stack Exchange post entitled <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/312365/rollout-of-new-network-site-themes"">Rollout of new network site themes</a> (and maybe the posts it links to for the full background).

2645,26769,,1,,2,,85,1,0,,,Community Promotion Ads — 2019,<discussion><community-ads>,CC BY-SA 4.0,"<p>2019 is here! And with the new year, as usual, comes a new iteration of <strong>Community Promotion Ads</strong>! Let’s refresh these for the coming year :)</p>

<h3>What are Community Promotion Ads?</h3>

<p>Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.</p>

<h3>Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?</h3>

<p>This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:</p>

<ul>
<li>the site's twitter account</li>
<li>financial blogs and websites</li>
<li>cool events or conferences</li>
<li>anything else your community would genuinely be interested in</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal is for future visitors to find out about <em>the stuff your community deems important</em>. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are <em>relevant to your own community's interests</em>, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. </p>

<h3>Why do we reset the ads every year?</h3>

<p>Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.</p>

<p>The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>

<p>The answers you post to this question <em>must</em> conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>All answers should be in the exact form of:</p>

<pre><code>[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]

   [1]: http://image-url
   [2]: http://clickthrough-url 
</code></pre>

<p>Please <strong>do not add anything else to the body of the post</strong>. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.</p></li>
<li><p>The question must always be tagged with the magic <a href=""/questions/tagged/community-ads"" class=""post-tag moderator-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;community-ads&#39;"" rel=""tag"">community-ads</a> tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Image requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li>The image that you create must be 300 x 250 pixels, or double that if high DPI.</li>
<li>Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)</li>
<li>Must be GIF or PNG</li>
<li>No animated GIFs</li>
<li>Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB</li>
<li>If the background of the image is white or partially white, there must be a 1px border (2px if high DPI) surrounding it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Score Threshold</h3>

<p>There is a <strong>minimum score threshold</strong> an answer must meet (currently <strong>6</strong>) before it will be shown on the main site.</p>

<p>You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/2645"">here</a>.</p>

<p>We're not really a translation service here.  ""What is the word for X in Y language/dialect"" is not a great question on this site.</p>

<p>Why?  Because, in part, what you saw: most of us don't know, and can't do anything more than google what it is ourselves.  </p>

<p>But also, in part, because it's not really doing anything more than taking one technical term and making it into another technical term.  </p>

<p>It's also not really what you want to know, at the end of the day.  What you wanted to know is, what is the term in American English for [the concept that debt prescription means in South African English]?  And the way you get to that is by asking <em>that</em> question.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In South Africa, we use the term ""debt prescription"" to refer to debts that are considered no longer valid after a period of time.  An example would be if a person were to owe a debt, and then many years pass, there is a point at which they no longer are considered to owe that debt, and could not be sued in a court of law.  How can I refer to this concept in American English?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Brythan tried to help you get to this in the comments, but you didn't take their advice.</p>

<p>The important thing here is to explain the term in neutral (non-regional) language, and to include more information in your question. Your initial question was simply too short and cursory, and while someone was able to guess at what you wanted, that's not really how we prefer to operate here; we're happy to answer complete, clear questions.</p>

<p>We'd also prefer not to have to do work in order to <em>understand</em> the question.  Notice the answerer appears to have first worked out what 'debt prescription' means, and then translated it.  A good question will already contain that information.  This not only gets you a better answer, but it saves the <em>volunteers</em> who answer your question time too.</p>

<p>Hopefully that helps you understand why it was closed, and what you can do to get better answers in the future!

2650,82212,,1,,5,,109,1,0,,,Seemingly Opinion-Based Answers,<discussion><answers>,CC BY-SA 4.0,"<p>I'm a fairly active user over on StackOverflow for my job/hobby and while I was at work <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/104950/how-can-i-prepare-for-my-us-student-debt"">this question</a> popped up on my feed. It is something that I <em>feel</em> I have some expertise around. However, when showing this post to my co-workers, we both provided facts, life experiences, wisdom, etc. that were completely opposite of each other. One was pro debt, the other was opposed. </p>

<p>I checked the <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/faq""><code>faq</code></a> and the <code>answers</code> tag, but couldn't find anything on <em>seemingly</em> opinionated answers. On StackOverflow, code either runs (or is correct) or doesn't run (or is incorrect). I feel it's a <em>more</em> black and white area than Personal Finance. I am aware that Primarily-Opinion Based questions are off topic for this site. But <code>Primarily</code> is the word that is tripping me up. Personal finance can sometimes be, well, personal.</p>

<p>Before I start answering questions - Am I allowed to give answers, that may <em>seem</em> opinion based to others, as long as I explain my reasoning, provide facts/data, etc.? or are the questions that would lead to such an answer be deemed ""off topic"" and <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2149/is-it-acceptable-to-answer-an-off-topic-question"">therefore inappropriate to leave an answer</a></p>

2651,187,,2,,6,2650,,,1,,,,,CC BY-SA 4.0,"<p>There are questions regarding math and taxes which are facts. If I answer correctly, no one would argue, only perhaps offer a better articulated answer. That's easy. </p>

<p>Then there are the questions that ask for ""what am I missing"" such as those that want to buy a house. Even if the numbers work, members might offer details the OP might be missing. In that case, you can tell me my house is too big, but can't argue the new roof just cost $24K. These might be the tip of the gray area, where opinions come into play, but the answers are still fact based. </p>

<p>The larger gray area is pretty gray. Some of those questions slip through, other are closed. To your point, if the question remain open, the answer should be fact based. Some members have a strong opinion. One feels you should never buy a new car. Others would say to only buy a new car with cash. Neither position is a fact, but both members present theirs with enough detail that both answers garner points. We each have our own risk tolerance. For example, I say that one should prioritize matched 401(k) deposits, even ahead of paying off debt (so long as the debt payoff has a sound plan). Others say pay debt 100% before investing a dime. I can justify my decisions, math, numbers, etc, but in the end, it's my choice, and I respect those who disagree and choose a different path. I retired at 50, so I must have done something right. Still there are those who think early retirement is insane..... I could go on. </p>

<p>In the end, if you feel you have something to contribute, do so. As with other stacks, good answers are voted up. New members that start to answer old question but done any any idea/fact not contained in other existing answers are, to be blunt, annoying. On the other hand, there are <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/unanswered"">1537 questions with no upvoted or accepted answers</a>. Those are worth addressing, along with other recent questions. Looking forward to seeing you participate. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>When should I delete questions?</strong></p>
<p>Closed questions that are of no lasting value whatsoever should be flagged and deleted.</p>
<p>Before voting to delete, please check whether there are <strong>any good answers</strong>; if so, then the question should be flagged for moderator attention as a potential merge candidate. We don't like to lose great answers!</p>
<p>Also, be cautious when deleting questions closed as <strong>duplicates</strong>; they can serve as a signpost, directing users to useful answers on another question.</p>
<p>It takes <strong>3</strong> votes, minimum, to delete a closed question. However, the number of delete votes required scales to the number of votes on the question and all its answers.</p>

This question was closed over 10 months ago, with no such edit, and didn’t appear to be fixable. </p>

<p>I asked in a mod chat area, how other stacks handle this, and consensus was that these questions should be deleted. Why do you feel a closed question should remain indefinitely? </p>

<p>We’ve already had the meta discussion that votes don’t always reflect a good question or answer, and the CMs have written how an unclear or off topic question that somehow hits HNQ can quickly gain votes. But it should still be closed, and if not fixable, deleted. </p>

<p>The same day the question was posted, and the votes to close appeared, the comment also was posted -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I voted to close this question as unclear what you're asking. I have
  no idea what it is you're upset about or what the lender is doing or
  not doing in response to whatever it is you think you're doing or how
  anything written in your question could be construed as unethical
  and/or illegal. What are the terms of the loan? What is due? What are
  you paying? What are they doing? Did you purposely leave all of the
  relevant details out of the question?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the time, I thought to myself - this question will either get a good edit or a close with no help from mods. That's good, in general I think having my name added to fewer closed questions is better. The OP made no effort to edit those details quid had asked for. The question, although closed, remained available to edit, but also to show up as a 'related question' when on the site. That prompted me to talk to other stack's mods. </p>

<p>In general, I encourage members to let an OP return to address issues before closing a question, my own thought is that people should be given 24+ hours for a return visit. Once they've either edited or commented they won't, a close is fair. </p>

<p>I'd ask you a question in return - If 5 members close a question, but it remains visible, and it goes unedited/improved, what would be your criteria for deletion? I personally find it annoying to see closed questions on 'related'. They remain a reminder that something needs fixing.  </p>

<p>Reopen. (Agree with Ganesh)  It was suggested in a comment on the question that it be closed as a ""gambling"" question, as questions about gambling are listed as <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">off-topic</a>.  However, in my mind, the spirit of the ""no gambling"" rule is to disallow questions about the details of playing games like blackjack or poker, which some might consider to be ""money"" or ""personal finance"" questions if we didn't have this rule.  The question we are looking at here is about how gambling relates to investing, and investing is on-topic on our site.</p>

2662,187,366,1,,5,,288,4,0,,,Member discussion on Closed vs Deleted,<discussion><closing-questions>,CC BY-SA 4.0,"<p>I am resurrecting a discussion of Closed vs Deleted. It seems that there was consensus some time ago, as these questions showed:</p>

<p><a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/415/deleting-closed-question-of-no-value-is-not-happening"">Deleting Closed Question of No Value is not happening</a>  (Oct '11) - This question actually addresses the reasons to delete, Off Topic (almost always delete). And other examples followed.</p>

<p><a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1872/deleting-closed-questions"">Deleting Closed Questions</a> (Dec '13) - Which, interestingly, begins ""Deletion of closed questions is not happening to the extent required."" No answers were offered, but a member commented and agreed with the effort.</p>

<p>The purpose here, now, is to get a pulse of members' thoughts on this. The CM statement on the status ""closed"" is that it's a limbo state, during which time a question is a candidate to improve for potential reopen, or to be deleted if the reopen never happens. </p>

<p>Recently, there has been objection to the deletion of questions that may have had 'good' answers that were highly voted. This, of course, forces the question of whether a 'bad' question (say off-topic) can somehow be turned valuable by a well crafted answer.  </p>

<p>In Dec '16, we had the Meta question <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2395/how-do-we-discourage-high-rep-users-from-answering-questions-that-are-clearly-of"">How do we discourage high-rep users from answering questions that are clearly off-topic?</a> which gives a nice list of examples of this happening. In one case, the question is voted +68, and the top answer +148. To be clear, I'd be just as happy to see the question edited and voted open. If it's closed, it's closed for a reason. </p>

<p>I would like to hear from members on both sides, those who would look at the Meta posts I linked and agreeing with that, have no objection to continued deletions, as well as those who would prefer otherwise. </p>

<p>On the other hand, I do think off-topic questions clutter up the site, and also encourage more of the same to be posted. Mostly they get high votes because of HNQ, and I don't think the votes actually reflect the quality.</p>

2664,10997,10997,2,,0,2662,,,17,,,,,CC BY-SA 4.0,"<p>I understand, philosophically, the idea that old, closed questions should be deleted.  However, the issue that we have on our site is that there is a lot of controversy on a lot of closed questions.  We don't have agreement right now on what should be closed and what shouldn't.</p>

<p>The system, in general, is biased towards closing questions.  It takes at most 5 votes to close a question. (Often questions are closed with fewer than 5 votes.)  While questions are acquiring close votes, there is no explicit way for users to vote to keep a question open.    After the question is closed, 5 more users can vote to reopen a question, but this rarely happens for a number of reasons: the question can't get bumped to the top with new answers, the users who thought that the question should have remained open have already seen the question and interacted with it before it was closed, and they don't get notified when the question gets closed.  And moderators are reluctant to reopen questions closed by other users unless a meta discussion about the question occurs.  In addition, reopen votes expire fairly quickly, and there is a waiting period before a reopen vote can be reissued.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that there is no explicit way for users to vote to keep a question open while it is in the process of being closed, there are <em>de facto</em> methods for users to express their desire to keep a question open.  When a user upvotes a question or posts an answer to a question, they are in effect expressing their opinion that the question is on-topic and should remain open.  I understand that it is often said that ""high votes don't equate to on-topic,"" but at the same time we can't ignore that high votes (or even just a few positive votes) indicate that there were users who thought the question had merit.</p>

<p>As a result of the bias toward closing questions, we have a lot of questions on our site that have been closed, and yet I (and others, I think) believe that many of these were closed in error and should be reopened.</p>

<p>We could discuss each of these questions on meta and try to come to consensus on which ones should be reopened, which ones can be reopened with edits, and which ones were closed legitimately.  However, this activity will take a long time to complete, and it is debatable if this is a valuable use of all of our time and effort.</p>

<p>A viable alternative is to simply refrain from manually deleting closed questions <em>en masse</em>.  By not deleting these questions, we honor the desire of the users and moderators who originally closed the question, and we also don't destroy the hard work of the users who spent their time and effort answering these questions that they believe are actually on-topic.  This also allows the debate on what constitutes an open-worthy question to continue without putting an artificial timetable or deadline on it.</p>

<p>Stack Exchange has an auto delete feature (dubbed the Roomba) that automatically deletes questions under certain criteria.  Closed questions with no positive score answers will eventually be deleted without any user action necessary.  There really is no reason why users <em>must</em> go around deleting closed questions with any urgency.</p>

<p>To be fair, I think there are rare times when manual deletion of questions is warranted.  We want to delete questions whose presence is actively harmful to our site or to our readers.  Spam should be swiftly deleted, as should posts with abusive language.  Sometimes we get questions where the OP decides to post their bank account number; those need to be deleted quickly as well.  But off-topic questions with negative scores do not need to be manually deleted; the Roomba will clean that up.  And for questions that are closed as off-topic yet have good answers from respected users, we need to recognize that there is not consensus whether this question is really on-topic or not.  And waiting some arbitrary amount of time before deletion doesn't really address the issue.  One thing moderators might not realize is that manual deletion by a moderator is final; it is not possible for ordinary users to vote to undelete, and it cannot be undone by any process except another moderator action.</p>

<p>I have seen people make the argument that you shouldn't look at answers in deciding whether or not a question should be closed; that you can't turn an off-topic question into an on-topic question by writing an on-topic answer.  However, what that argument fails to take into account is that a good answer can show you how a question you originally thought was off-topic really is on-topic.  This happens all the time; users read a question and immediately think ""Too broad; This can't be answered concisely,"" or ""Primarily opinion-based; This can't be answered objectively.""  They might issue their close vote, but if someone comes along and answers concisely or objectively, that answerer has proven the close-voter wrong.  If an answer is written that is an on-topic answer, perhaps it means that the question simply needs a minor edit to be kept on-topic.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I don't see any need for our moderators to blindly follow some convention from other Stack Exchange sites in deleting closed questions without considering the opinions of the users who have voted up and answered these questions, indicating that they believe the questions should not have been closed.</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit: I would just like to point out that my answer here is the compromise option. Some users want to delete lots of questions, not content with them being closed. Others (myself included) think that many of those should be reopened. The compromise solution is to simply leave them closed and not deleted, but able to be re-opened or re-closed if the consensus changes in the future on any individual questions, preserving without officially endorsing the work of answerers. </p>

<p>It seems like this is more a question of 'should we close as much as we do', then I'll tend to fall on the side of 'keeping more questions open', though I tend to think we do okay on that front for the most part.  Either way, though, that's a different discussion than delete/not delete closed questions.</p>

<p>Keeping closed questions around for long enough for people to have expressed opinions on their closed status and then not deleting them afterwards just means we have more examples of poor questions on the site; it's not likely to be found by anyone (since it's not indexed) and not likely to be reopened at that point.</p>

Any answer is going to boil down to identifying the motivations of the lawmakers who wrote and passed the relevant laws, rather than any useful personal financial reasoning. As such it is off topic here, as <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2302/16377"">this Meta answer also establishes</a>.</p>

<p>When I went to flag it, I couldn't identify a good flag to use. I considered and rejected the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>""Questions on economics are off-topic unless they relate directly to personal finance."" It's not about economics. It's about the motivations of law makers.</li>
<li>""Blatantly off-topic (this question has nothing to do with money or personal finance)"" The question being related to 401ks, it does have some tangential relevance to personal finance. So this didn't seem appropriate either.</li>
<li>""This question belongs on another site in the Stack Exchange network"" Migrating to <a href=""https://politics.stackexchange.com/"">Politics</a> would actually be ideal, but it's not an option for migration.</li>
<li>""primarily opinion-based"" This seems inappropriate as well, as it's likely that advocates of the policy articulated their thoughts at the time it was written, debated, and passed.</li>
</ul>

<p>I didn't think any of the other reasons had relevant meanings, either.</p>

<p>So I flagged the post with a custom flag using the message,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is a political question, not a personal finance one.</p>

<p>The flag was declined with the message:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The main reason I wanted to see a standard flag was that it didn't feel clear-cut to me, and didn't have any close votes yet even though it had been fairly visible for a while. So I would have preferred it went through the review queues so several members could decide whether to close it rather than it be my binding decision.</p>

<p>I've now taken a closer look at the question and the meta question you linked to, and my personal view is to leave the question open. As Ben Miller said in <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2302/366"">his answer</a>, quite a similar question has been seen as on-topic in the past. While it is veering into politics, specific features of the existing tax system can generally be explained with a reasonable degree of objectivity, and I think those explanations are reasonably relevant to personal finance. Wide-ranging questions about why things aren't completely different are too much about politics and too little about personal finance.</p>

<p>For users who have enough reputations to cast close votes, they're forced to use the custom close reason that will post the ""I'm voting to close this question because ..."" comment.</p>

<p>However, for users who don't have the close vote privilege, if they think a question needs to be closed but there is no suitable flag, then the most recommended way is to use ""blatantly off-topic"" reason because it means the question is off-topic <em>according to the site's scope</em>. Also, it's <strong>very recommended</strong> to post a comment and explain why they think it's off-topic (just as when users with close vote privilege choose the custom close reason).</p>

<p>Doing this gives the advantage of getting the question reviewed by the community.</p>

<hr>

<p>Using custom moderator flag is <strong>not</strong> recommended because it bypasses the community and directly goes to the mods, as has been explained by Ganesh. However, if you're trying to get it migrated instead, then a clearer message with the actionable request would be appreciated. Instead of</p>

<p>When seeing the first message, mods would probably be confused if you're trying to get it closed, migrated, or... something else. But reading the second message, mods would understand it better that there's no migration path to there and could consider if it's more suitable on there. (Whether the flag would be rejected or accepted is a different story though)</p>

<p>But in the end, if you're trying very hard to find a reason for a question to get it closed, then perhaps the question shouldn't really be closed? (Or, ""don't close a question just for the sake of getting it closed""?)</p>

<p>The issue as I saw it was that by flagging, it needed to be addressed by a mod. The question, along with those Ben Miller cited, are in that gray area. Say it was 6 years ago, and the first question we got of the form ""Why is this bit of tax code the way it is....?"" resulted in an instant flood of political answers, nothing one could really call remotely related to PF.

The test is primarily, <em>would an expert in personal finance be an expert on this question?</em>  And in that it clearly fails: expertise in personal finance likely makes you worse at answering this question if anything, as it makes you more likely to buy an intelligent car rather than a luxury car.</p>

<p>The expertise to answer a question about ""what a luxury car has over regular cars"" is that of a car expert, not a finance expert, and so it is off topic here.</p>

<p>It's not that it's opinion - on a car site, that question would be <em>totally</em> fine, in my opinion.  It is the topicality itself, not the opinion, that makes it inappropriate for this site.</p>

<p>This is the part that is clearly opinion, and doesn't <em>really</em> fit on the site, though I think we've had questions in this vein before.  By itself it might be an okay question, but the answer is really simple - because people like nice things, and sometimes the point of having money is to have those nice things.  The detail beyond that - what's in luxury cars in particular that makes them nice and worth buying - isn't on topic here.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>And this is definitely automotive.  This is great on an automotive site (the OP of this meta question suggested one, I believe, though I can't speak for that site's topic area).  It's just not a finance question - it's something where you need to know things about cars to answer.</p>

The element of 'book' does not matter in the slightest, but the question should be a good question <em>regardless of the book's existence</em>.  The questions that are on topic here are good questions where the book is context - for example, asking how to calculate some finance term, providing the book reference for where they get the equation is useful to the question.</p>
<p>But in your case, your question wasn't very good because you just pasted the text of the book (in an image) and asked to define a few terms.  That doesn't have sufficient outside context to actually make sense - it's just something in the book itself.  Phrased differently, you might get a better reception, if you put some context for how this is a relevant personal finance question.  Making up an example (not from your question):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm reading up on how to handle tenant evictions on properties I owned, and I notice that [this book] includes this sentence:</p>

<p>When evicting a tenant, you usually hire the sheriff's office to carry out the notice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is a &quot;sheriff&quot; in this context?  Is this the local police force?  Or do they have some more specific meaning?</p>

<p>That's a good finance question because it shows how it's related to our topic area (being a landlord is a common investment strategy, if a risky one), puts a small amount of context from the book, and asks clearly a question that could stand without the book.</p>

<p>I've been mulling this conversation over for a while. We have two conflicting problems that we're trying to reconcile here. We want to keep the site clean, but there are some questions that might be salvageable with some effort. We close questions that are off-topic knowing that with effort the questions could be improved and reopened. It takes time and effort to edit a question to be a better fit for this site. <strong>Whose responsibility is it to make those edits?</strong></p>
<p><strong>The OP</strong> (the most motivated party who wants an answer) often a new user asking that doesn't have enough context about what is on-topic to make the edits. They are easily discouraged and they're not terribly invested, so the level of abandonment is high. We have some responsibility to be nice and to point them in the right direction, but that's often not enough.</p>
<p><strong>The invested user base</strong> (anyone with enough rep to vote to close or reopen) sees an ever increasing volume of low quality questions and probably make some close votes in a reactionary way. Arguments might sap motivation, etc., but the core users can and should be doing the bulk of the work here. Still we are all volunteers, all we can do is ask for help.</p>
<p><strong>The moderators</strong> have to deal with flags, spam, and everything else that crosses the site and there are fewer of them. As far as I'm concerned they should be calling balls and strikes when arguments break out, and doing cleanup that can't be done by high rep users.</p>

<p>I have dozens of deleted posts, and I started looking through them today to see if there were any I still cared about. I found a few, but not many. There were some poorly written questions that I answered that were closed, and I didn't put any effort into getting them reopened. That was my bad, and I probably should have acted before they were deleted. If I put the effort into answering a question that I felt was close enough to on-topic, I should put in the edits required to make the case for reopening. So my final conclusion is that the majority of the responsibility for editing a question to make it unambiguously on topic is:</p>
<p><strong>The answerers</strong> who are often high-rep users who are interested enough in the topic to spend some time answering. If they're motivated enough to provide an answer, they should also put some effort into advocating for the asker.</p>
<p>I believe that if we put some effort into encouraging high-rep users to own the questions they answer, we'll have fewer questions with good answers staying closed long-term.</p>
<h2>If no one puts the effort in to reopen them, should they be deleted?</h2>
<p>Generally, yes. With probably a few exceptions.</p>
<p>Most of them have probably been abandoned. Unless someone is willing to put in the effort needed as discussed above, new answers with updated information cannot be added, so even if the information in the answers was good (though off-topic) they may become outdated, and again, the motivation appears to be lower to maintain content on questions that are closed.</p>

<p>I haven’t reviewed any of your edits, but I want to share some thoughts about the practice. Again, I’m not saying that these apply to your edits on this question, as I have not reviewed it. </p>

<p>When editing a question that already has answers, make sure you don’t invalidate any existing answers with your edit. If a question requires such severe edits that all of the existing answers are invalidated, then the effort is sort of wasted. (The purpose, after all, is preserving answers.)</p>

<p>Preemptively editing questions that have not yet been closed is tricky. Yes, it is good if you succeed in keeping the question from getting closed, but the danger is potentially changing a question that is really good as-is, overreacting to a lone close vote. </p>

<p>I think these actions are valuable in general, but keep in mind that it is very labor-intensive. If the only reason we are doing this is to keep good answers from getting deleted, that is a shame, as it is very easy and requires no effort from anyone to just <em>refrain from deleting the questions</em>.</p>

<p>As well-intentioned users such as yourself begin the slow process of trying to rescue questions from the reaper, I would ask the mods once again to refrain from deletion. You can’t assume that a question that hasn’t been edited has no support. It could be that the question is okay to be reopened as-is, or that it just hasn’t been noticed yet, or even that it did indeed receive enough reopen votes, just not all within the required short time window. Deletion makes the question almost impossible for anyone to find and fix. </p>

<p>Essentially, your question is off-topic because the question's title begins <em>""Should I...""</em> and the question goes on to describe the idea of selling naked OOM puts on the finance sector. <strong>That's a specific investment</strong> and the <em>""Should I""</em> makes the question, more or less, a request for buy/sell advice. The part about <em>""bank sector has been quite flat and underperform""</em> also calls for <strong>evaluation of conditions</strong>.</p>

<p>Perhaps a better question to ask would be along the lines of ""Here's a strategy I'm thinking of employing.

<p>For example, take the <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/109924/am-i-being-scammed-by-a-sugar-daddy"">latest sugar daddy question</a>.  Does anyone really think this is a question posed by a scholar of logic?  I almost think the question itself is a scam, laughing at serious, literal us.</p>

<p>On English Language and Usage, we get some extremely basic questions, badly posed, with no evidence of research.  But these are posed by earnest students of English as a second language, often burdened by a semi-literate teacher, and one should be thankful that one is not among this group, and try to help them.  This is done by some with a short answer to the Q in a comment and then immediately downvoting and VTCing, or if the question is elementary but shows some research or thought, voting to migrate to English Language Learners.</p>

<p>Is rapid downvoting and VTCing impractical here?  Why did the sugar daddy question get a net of 12 upvotes and a star?  How many downvotes did it get besides mine?  </p>

<p>I suppose all this attention was because it got on the HNQ.  Any way to prevent idiotic questions from going on the HNQ? </p>

<p>This is perhaps the fourth such question I have seen since becoming fairly active on this site, and I am getting tired of them.  Not to mince words, they are a slum neighborhood in an otherwise great site. </p>

The similar question was discussed nearly 3 years ago, and was part of the motivation for creating the <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2376/frequently-answered-questions-by-topic"">FAQ</a> which sits in Meta. As I look at that, we have 4 questions for scams there. If I recall correctly, these were chosen to try to cover a few different types of scams which would cover some large percent of the new questions. (If we need to edit any of these 4 or add other examples that differ, let’s do it) 
This is what the FAQ shows -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Moderators <strong>can manually remove questions from HNQ</strong>. Could you start a
  meta discussion <strong>specifically about establishing a policy that we
  should always do it for questions about scams?</strong> If it's agreed I'd
  certainly be happy to implement that, either when I see things
  organically or in response to flags. (emphasis added.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>What do users think about this proposal?</strong> </p>

<p>Do users think that scam questions are valuable because they are a service to confused people, or because they generate interest in the site, or for some other reason?  Or do users think that sugar daddy questions or Nigerian Prince questions or other <strong>obvious</strong> scam questions should be discouraged by removing from the HNQ List (when they occur there) and by downvoting,  VTCing, flagging, and using whatever other options we have?</p>

<p>Hmmm, that paragraph wasn't exactly a neutrally phrased question, was it?  Feel free to react non-neutrally!</p>

<p>Finally, this question complements the Meta question that I linked to the second paragraph, but <strong>this question is about a specific action that a moderator has suggested as an option.</strong>  Thus it is not a duplicate.                 </p>

<p>On the flip side, I'd hope to maintain a welcoming atmosphere, one that says ""Welcome. You've asked a question here that we've actually answered a number of times.... please read these other Q&amp;As and see the advice we've given."" The votes to close should come with the link to a duplicate question so the asker can see we have clearly addressed it before. Downvoting? That tends to be off-putting in a way I'd like to avoid. New members don't always ""take the tour"" or spend any time checking out what makes for a good question. DVs feel aggressive as compared to helpful. </p>

<p>We have enough good questions that hit HNQ, we can choose a few tags that blacklisting from HNQ will be ok. Scam, and Bitcoin, in my opinion. </p>

<p>In response to Ben's comment and answer - HNQ is interesting in that it often becomes the question that gets an existing SE member to visit Money.SE. In my own thinking, HNQ should represent a ""best of"" sort of post, or at least one that a member would say ""this is why I visit Money.SE"". Is there any scam post that falls into that group? Not for me. We have 2 issues. The effort to categorically 'close as duplicate' discussed at another Meta post, and the HNQ issue. For HNQ, I believe the bar should be lower and not attract members whose interest isn't likely to be more broad PF issues. </p>

<p>The HNQ is a good thing for our site. It is how many new users find us. In fact, I would argue that it is the path that the best new users find us through, because the HNQ brings new users that are already familiar with the Stack Exchange environment.</p>

<p>If we are considering banning a class of questions from the HNQ (or even banning an individual question), we need to consider what the problems are that we are intending to solve. And I just don’t see any problems that these questions being on the HNQ are causing. </p>

<p>Yes, the scam questions can get tiresome to those of us who have been around for a while. But we don’t have to read them if we don’t want to. Yes, the HNQ causes high vote counts for those posts. That’s not a problem for anyone except the jealous. </p>

<p>Questions with negative scores, closed questions and duplicate questions will not appear on the HNQ. Scam questions are on-topic in general, but many could be closed as duplicate. And when we get a unique scam question, I see no reason why it shouldn’t be featured on the HNQ. </p>

<p>I could see the argument that questions about “sugar daddies” are in poor taste, and we don’t want to promote that on our site. Okay, but if that is the reason, let’s be clear on that and only remove “sugar daddy” questions from the HNQ and not just scam questions in general. </p>

<p>The ability for moderators to manually remove questions from the HNQ is a recent addition, which was created to address the issue of questions that are on-topic for a site but with titles that could be considered in poor taste when seen out of context on other sites. The “sugar daddy” questions potentially qualify for that designation, but not scam questions in general. </p>

<p>In my opinion, manual removal of questions should be determined on a case-by-case basis, and should be an extremely rare event, done for a specific reason to solve a specific problem. </p>

<p>The question could <em>MAYBE</em> be worth answering if the person actually cared what the scam was; but these are one word answer questions. </p>

<p>Yes. </p>

<p>It borders on offensive to even expect anyone to read the whole scenario laid out in the questions.  It has nothing to do with personal finance apart from involving money by simple virtue of being a scam.  Should I buy a size 10 shoe or size 11 if I normally wear a 10.5 but this brand doesn't make half sizes? Is equally close to being a personal finance question as it takes money to buy shoes.</p>

<p>These questions wouldn't be irritating if they were less frequent.  It hardly feels valuable to entertain a bad question from a 1 rep newcomer who will never come back after being reassured of the scam they've found themselves involved in.</p>

<p>Users with a reputation of <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/164899/232449"">less than 125 need to wait 3 minutes between posting answers</a>.  The reason for the rate limit is that they want to discourage new users from flooding a site with potentially poor answers, as well as slowing down spam posting attempts. Stack Exchange founder Jeff Atwood wrote a blog post <a href=""https://blog.codinghorror.com/rate-limiting-and-velocity-checking/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">explaining the rationale behind rate limits</a>.</p>

<p>Focussing on the mechanics of how any given scam works would not be broad enough to cover any possible solution; instead such an answer should focus on laying out the principles that allow the general reader to immediately see that a scam is in place. Links below each section to typical questions with these situations may also help.</p>

<p>1) No one will give you money for nothing - if a 'job' would take you 5 minutes to complete, it won't earn you a full day's wage; if you've never met someone they won't give you their inheritance; and no 'investment manager' is able to earn guaranteed high returns on your quick investment.</p>

<p>2) Never transfer money on someone else's behalf - even back to that same person! This can be a sign of money laundering, or an attempt to defraud you (see links to check clearing fraud).</p>

<p>3) Online evidence is easy to fake - websites, photos, documents, anything you see online can be created to give you a false sense of security. Don't believe anything you get from someone you've never met.</p>

<p>4) Anyone who opens up, out of the blue after never having met you, to offer you money [either as 'job offer', 'investment plan', 'inheritance', or anything else] is a scammer.</p>

<p><a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/q/111312/81248"">Credit card details stolen every 1-2 years. What am I doing wrong?</a></p>

<p>Which, per a recent comment, has generated a lot of very different answers.  Many of the answers have very helpful parts, but even answers with helpful parts have sections that generated a lot of disagreement or are probably even wrong (see any answer that mentions RFID blocking wallets, which isn't applicable to me anyway because my card doesn't have an RFID chip).</p>

<p>As a result it's making it very difficult for me to pick an answer to accept.  From my perspective, I'll probably follow advice from two different answers - use cash only in stores and use a service that hides my credit card details for online transactions.  Out of everything, these seem like the two steps that will have the most hope of minimizing future fraud.  Unfortunately, there isn't an answer that (in my opinion) brings everything together well.</p>

<p>As a result I'm not sure what to do.  I would like this question to have a good, solid answer for anyone who comes by in the future, but I don't feel like there is one answer that fits that bill.  The only thing I can think of is to write an answer that brings everything together.  However, since I would just be working in things from other answers, it seems unreasonable for me to write and accept such an answer myself.  Therefore I was thinking about looking into writing an answer and turning it into a community wiki if possible.  The problem with that is it still leaves the original posters with helpful answers uncredited.  Editing some of the answers seems doesn't seem like it would work either since getting a more complete answer would require substantial changes to any one answer.</p>

Nearly two years ago (October 2017), another ""old bereavement-related question"" (originally asked in <strong>2015</strong>) popped onto the front page because someone else provided a new (not very good, IMHO) answer. I answered that one before I realized that the original was so old.</p>

<p>In both cases, the person who asked the question has very likely already dealt with the issue they were asking about: answering such questions is unlikely to help <em>them</em> but will – if they are still active on PF&amp;M – bring the bereavement back into their minds when they see the notification of a new answer. However, as PF&amp;M is trying to be a ""<em>library of detailed answers to every question about money or personal finance</em>"", having such questions answered is part of our <em>raison d'être</em>, and we should be trying to help anyone else with the same problem in the future.</p>

If we're lucky they at least stick around to read answers to their question :-) Unless they get email notifications, which <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/120692/settings-for-email-notification-for-activity-on-questions-ive-asked"">I think is opt in</a>, they will never know about new answers.</p>

<p>My view is that (1) is the best option. It's pretty hard to second guess what people's reaction will be, and adding an explicit apology probably doesn't help much. If the user has stuck around, they'll probably have some idea how the network works so it shouldn't be too much of a surprise. If repeated answers are an issue they can always flag the post for us to disassociate from them. Of course I appreciate the user would have to know they can do that and may not want to go to that extra effort. But we do at least have that safety valve.</p>

<p>BTW in the example you refer to, the question is on the front page because someone posted a nonsense answer that has now been deleted. The protection was done after that to prevent future junk. Because the answers were deleted quite quickly, it's unlikely they'd have made it into an email notification, which are only sent every 24 hours by default.</p>

<p>Additionally, IMO the references to ""whiny, inconvenienced snowflakes"" are still rude/unfriendly even though you don't directly accuse the OP of that. You're certainly suggesting it as a serious possibility.</p>

<p>Here's a copy of the answer, for those who can't see it directly:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let's say you do get the loan <strong>before</strong> you have the job and are
  settled it.  AKA, you counted your chickens before they hatched.</p>
  
  <p>Imagine these scenarios:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>You <strong>don't</strong> get the job.</li>
  <li>Your take-home pay is a lot less than you thought it would be.</li>
  <li>The company downsizes a month later.</li>
  <li>You <strong>really hate the job</strong> (as opposed to being a whiny, inconvenienced snowflake who can't hack a little so-called
  ""oppression"" by The Man).</li>
  <li>You <em>actually are</em> a whiny, inconvenienced snowflake who can't hack a little so-called ""oppression"" by The Man, and ghost the job.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>Then... you have no income and are left with a loan payment.</p>
  
  <p>The bottom line is that <strong>debt is risk</strong>, and a 19 year old  shouldn't
  put him or herself at risk without a job firmly in place.</p>

2751,26770,,2,,5,2749,,,3,,,,,CC BY-SA 4.0,"<p>So there isn't actually any bug here, and it takes some explanation of how the review queues work to get to why it's not a bug.</p>

<p><strong>The review page is not a good indicator of whether <em>your</em> suggested edit is still pending.</strong></p>

<p>The number of tasks displayed there is a live count of how many <em>you</em>, personally can review. That count does not include anything you own or tasks you've already reviewed. So for you, it <em>should</em> display 0 if there are no other available tasks, because you can't review your own edit.</p>

<p><strong>Most review queues reserve tasks when opened.</strong></p>

<p>When a user views the task for the first time, they start a 5-minute grace period where that task is specifically reserved to them to complete. This prevents tasks being assigned out to a bunch of users and leaving other users with an already-completed task because they weren't quite as fast. This reservation simply prevents it being given out to someone else who visits the review queue until the time expires, but others can still access it at any time with a direct link.</p>

<p>So users here who are just visiting the review page and seeing that it's not popping up when they try to review - it shouldn't, because people stopping by keep reserving it out to themselves and preventing it dropping as a normal task for anyone else.</p>

<p><strong>This task just hadn't been reviewed yet.</strong></p>

<p>One person did review it. But five people also skipped it. That's consistent with the number of people who have been active at all in the review queue over the past few days. You just got unlucky in that other reviewers didn't feel comfortable making a decision on that edit.</p>

<p>While there are some who post derogatory remarks, the vast majority are simply trying to help where their expertise is relevant.</p>

<p>Stack Exchange divided up its site into separate communities so that each community can be focused on well-defined topics. It also requires answers to be objectively correct, which in turn imposes obligations on questions that are asked.</p>

<p>If you find comments or answers that run counter to the good will that the site intended, feel free to raise a flag for the moderators to take a look and, if appropriate, to take action.</p>

<p>Note also that the site intends to be a permanent repository of good answers to questions that pertain to specific topics. However, what constitutes a ‘good’ answer is left to the community to decide - that’s what the up/down voting is for. Likewise for whether a question fits within the ‘on-topic’ guidelines listed in the help section.</p>

<p>Questions that are off-topic or that aren’t sufficiently well-posed to get an authoritative answer don’t really help others. In Stack Exchange, these questions can be voted to be placed on hold for awhile so that they can be edited and improved. If that editing process doesn’t help, the status of those questions switches to ‘closed’.</p>

<p>Questions that are already in the repository don’t need copy-paste answers. The site provides a mechanism to close such questions as duplicates that point to places containing answers.</p>

<p>Since all this is run by people (and almost all of it is by volunteers and visitors such as you and me), sometimes things do go wrong. The PF&amp;M Meta site is the place to air grievances and otherwise ask questions about the main PF&amp;M site.</p>

2769,10997,,2,,12,2767,,,1,,,,,CC BY-SA 4.0,"<p>I'm going to let you in on a fact that is not necessarily immediately obvious about our site: Most of the questions here in Personal Finance &amp; Money are opinion-based.  The reason for this is that personal finance is only partially about math.  Personal behavior weighs greatly in personal finance, and the ""correct"" approach in any situation will involve opinion.  Almost any question about budgeting, investing, or spending will involve at least an element of opinion.  Even something like tax law, which you might think should be black-and-white, cut-and-dried, often involve opinion to a great extent.  (<a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/q/36818/10997"">Exhibit A</a>)</p>

<p>""Primarily opinion-based"" exists as a close reason network-wide here on StackExchange, but different sites have different criteria for actually using it.  On a site like <a href=""https://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/"">Worldbuilding</a>, every question is entirely opinion-based.  For them, they have identified <a href=""https://worldbuilding.meta.stackexchange.com/a/5995/6684"">specific criteria</a> that a question has to meet to be allowed.  With other sites, such as programming, science, and technology sites, most of their questions are entirely objective, with a minimum of opinion.  Even on those sites, however, there are plenty of questions that involve opinion to make an answer.  (<a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/q/467575/90406"">Exhibit B</a>)</p>

<p>For our site, we have decided that we don't allow questions which are asking for predictions into the future.  Asking ""Should I buy XYZ stock?"", or ""Which is a better investment: Apple or Google?"" or ""Is now the right time to buy gold?"" are all closeable as primarily opinion-based because there is no objective answer possible without a time machine (or at least a crystal ball).  Sure, someone could come up with something that sounds like an objective answer using past performance, financial statements, etc., but we have decided as a site that we don't want future prediction speculation on our site.  </p>

<p>However, we do have open-ended advice questions on our site all the time, and these are not off-topic.  Indeed, they are among our most highly rated, interesting questions.  (<a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/q/47856/10997"">Exhibit C</a>, <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/q/1625/10997"">Exhibit D</a>).   </p>

<p>In my opinion, the question you are pointing to falls under this category.  The value of time is on-topic for personal finance, and although the topic is a matter of opinion, the answerers have proven that it can be discussed rationally and objectively.  It is a very interesting question that I hope does not get closed.  If it does get closed, I will vote to reopen.</p>

It's not as bad in this question, but the timeframe was very short (3 months) from co-sign to splitting up, so the situation is probably avoidable.</p>

<p>I have a doctorate in financial and monetary economics.  I have been a registered principal in a securities firm.  I have been a financial planner and investment advisor.  I also, at one point, worked in regulatory compliance.</p>

<p>In terms of research, my work includes proposing a new branch of stochastic calculus, which is currently in peer review.  The work I am doing should fundamentally rewrite the rules of economic modeling in finance and parts of macroeconomics.  It will also rewrite the rules of econometrics.  That, in turn, will rewrite many standard well-known ""truths"" of personal finance.</p>

<p>It has however been commented that I am a liar.  No real criticism, just ""you are a liar,"" followed by a bunch of downvotes.  Other attacks have been factually incorrect or misleading.</p>

<p>Although I have created answers that have been incorrect as I had misread the post, or in one case the regulation had changed and I was unaware, it seems that there is either a person or a small group that knows each other that seems to target people.</p>

<p>I am not certain if that person or group believes they are being helpful or if they are just angry at the world.</p>

<p>This forum is a bit more vulnerable than others because many of the questions here are highly specific, applied questions.  On other forums, questions have results where either it is easy to write a general mathematical proof or to cite a body of literature.</p>

<p>Here, however, questions may be subject to different answers in different jurisdictions, may change as law changes, may face conflicting laws, or may require the application of general principles to highly specific cases.  Whereas on a different type of forum, it is possible to cite based on empirical results, that is often not the case here.</p>

<p>For example, if someone asks about insurance law, it is inadequate to cite a statute.  Court cases also matter as the language of a statute only matters up to the point the courts say it does.  Citing relevant court cases requires access to costly resources.  Similar problems can exist for people wanting to discuss regulations in finance because there is a disharmony of law and regulation in quite a few cases.</p>

<p>Rules that apply in states that use grant deeds are very different from states that use traditional fee simple deeds with standard chains of title.  Because of that, it is easy for someone who doesn't know that states vary substantially to give an incorrect answer because they provided a correct answer for their jurisdiction but not another.</p>

<p>That makes this forum vulnerable to overgeneralization or overly specific answers.  The problem is that some individuals here seem to have strong feelings about answers.  I have seen it in others' answers as well.  The problem, for someone without content knowledge, is that if the best technical answer is voted down low enough, they may believe the best answer is actually wrong.</p>

<p>I would suggest just keep answering.  If your answer is helpful to the original asker, the votes don't matter.</p>

<p>We know you know about this already, so we'll keep this brief. The past two weeks have been rough. Lots of moderators have lost confidence in you; for some, it was the final straw. For many of us, though, we like being here and we don't want it to get to that point. So, in the past few days, a number of us have collaborated on writing you a letter.</p>
<p>We're worried about the direction that the company has been taking recently, and we're concerned that nobody in management has noticed or addressed that. The past couple of weeks have been the catalyst, finally, for us to write it all down in one place.</p>
<p>So, without further ado - please take 10 minutes out of your day to <strong><a href=""https://dearstack.artofcode.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">read the letter in full</a></strong>. It's not short, but we think it's important feedback that the company (and management in particular) needs to hear. Those of us who've already seen your <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/334551/an-apology-to-our-community-and-next-steps"">recent meta post</a> seem to be of the opinion that it's a good first step, and it's certainly touched on a number of the issues we've mentioned here, but there's plenty more work to do. We hope we can start working together with you again to get back to building communities.</p>

<p>Auto insurance in the US is regulated at the state level.  Different states require and allow different things of auto insurers.

<p>The answer offered by the person disagreeing is nothing but a series of anecdotes without naming a jurisdiction, but the answer uses harsh language and an authoritative tone so it got a lot of internet points. So this must be the right answer, right?</p>

2796,80766,,2,,2,2795,,,1,,,,,CC BY-SA 4.0,"<p>That's an interesting scenario, and while I'm not sure how it would be received from an on-topic perspective, I do think it is at least partially answerable. Questions like this often come up as a result of <a href=""https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/irs-form-8300-reference-guide"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">IRS Form 8300</a>, which is the vehicle by which FinCEN is alerted of possible money laundering transactions. Filings of this form are sometimes called CTRs (currency transaction reports). People seem interested in knowing how or why transactions are reported.</p>

<p>However, the thing people often forget is that only <em>cash</em> transactions are required to be reported via form 8300 - and only if they are over $10,000, or multiple transactions are made that total over $10,000. The goal of this regulation is to provide a method to capture transactions which involve moving funds in to or out of the (electronic) financial system. Changing funds back and forth between electronic and physical currency is often an important step in money laundering operations (because - while electronic funds leave a trail, paper money can be hard to track). Hence, the government needs a reporting mechanism in order to allow tracking of these transfers.</p>

<p>Your scenario of an electronic transfer would not, by default, strictly require reporting on a CTR.</p>

<p>That said, financial institutions are also required to report to FinCEN anything they consider suspicious. This type of reporting is often referred to as a SAR (suspicious activity report). This is somewhat open ended and there are not perfectly strict rules around what counts as suspicious, but generally most institutions look at patterns of behavior to determine what to report. Some even have automated reporting tools that pull potential transactions. A married couple with typical middle-class-American transaction volumes on a checking account (say, paychecks deposited every two weeks and several thousand dollars of debit card swipes, bill pays, etc to spend it back down) who received an 8-figure electronic transfer would almost certainly trigger any automated or human-decision flagging as suspicious activity. So, the answer to your question about when the IRS would know is almost certainly ""immediately.""</p>

<p>Perhaps the more important question, though, is what would the IRS do once they had that information. Based on my exposure to filing SARs, there is visible follow up on only a very small fraction of them. There are legitimate reasons to receive a large transfer which might not be illegal or even result in any tax burden (taking out a loan, receiving a gift).</p>

<p>As a slightly related footnote, in addition to the above, banks in the US are required to keep specific types of records about some electronic transfers (which would easily include your example), but these records are only required to be retained by the institution, not automatically supplied to the IRS. So these requirements don't directly impact your specific question.</p>

<p>This user has asked 12 questions about income tax in Canada in the last 16 hours or so. Most of them are referencing specific pages in a specific book from KPMG.</p>

<p>Assuming the benefit of the doubt (that this isn't somehow a shill for the book), I feel like the flood of questions is not going to be helpful for anyone. It's hard to even think about wading through them all and providing helpful, detailed answers (unless there's a Canadian tax accountant out there with a day or two of spare time on their hands). I am concerned that they're just going to age off the page and the user will be left helpless - and the questions will just be white noise taking up space on the until then.</p>

<p>I can vaguely remember a few times when we've had a flood of detailed, book-related questions like this in the past, but I can't find any examples after a few minutes of searching. Do we have a standard response for this? What's the best way to help a member with a wide range of very precise questions?</p>

I also feel the questions are quite specialised and not likely to be useful to anyone else unless they happen to be reading exactly the same book and have exactly the same set of problems with understanding it. They'd be better questions if the ratio of quote to original text was lower - e.g. if there was a bit more discussion of what exactly is hard to understand, and the quotation was more selective.</p>

<p>That said, I can't think of a reason they would actually be off-topic, and at least one of them did get an answer. So I'd be inclined to just vote on them as you would any other content and otherwise just move on. Eventually the unanswered ones <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/help/roomba"">will probably get cleaned up anyway</a>.</p>

<p>“Sugar daddy” seems to be the ultimate clickbait title phrase. But
honestly, the question is causing no problems. Yes, if you can find an
exact duplicate (which I don’t think would be too hard), feel free to
suggest it. And downvoting is certainly appropriate if you don’t like
the question. It is also very easy to ignore questions that don’t
interest you. But the site benefits from participation, and it is good
to see people participating on questions like this. I bet the HNQ is

<p>I would be happy to have members look at the list of <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sugar-daddy"">sugar-daddy</a> questions and help quantify the attributes that can offer maybe 3-5 questions that are the target of a fair 'closed as duplicate of....'. In other words, a new question is closed as it is one of these cited. I'd imagine this would help throttle the new ones remaining open a bit. Still, there might be a new one that has some unique issue and stays.</p>

Both a place to see typical good questions, and to find ones that can be used to support the 'duplicate' vote. In this case, a sugar-daddy set of 3-5 questions can be added under the scam section. To Ben's point in his comment, I'd be very careful when voting to close, it needs to be done kindly, and in a way that lets the asker know that they are not being told to go away, but to read other examples of how we've helped others with similar concerns.</p>

Here's the current question that triggered me into asking this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/119120/buying-new-car-at-18"">Buying new car at 18</a></p>

<p>We regularly get questions asking if something (usually a specific purchase or budget decision) is a ""good idea"" or not. To me, these questions are inherently opinion based and hence off topic, unless the asker gives some qualifications over what counts as ""good"" from their perspective.</p>

<p>Or, we get questions where someone is asking how to do something (get a specific loan, make a specific purchase) but the answers take on a tone of discussing whether or not that thing is worth doing, instead of addressing the actual question of <em>how</em> to accomplish a specific goal.</p>

<p>I think the problem stems from the fact that budgeting is inherently personal, and things that one person feels important (buying a car, making certain investment or savings choices, and so on) might seem like a ""waste of money"" to other people.</p>

<p>At best, people get answers to these questions that contain good thought points for the OP to consider as they make their decision. At worst, these questions sometimes seem to draw frame-challenge ""no, don't do that"" answers that are justified by the answerer's own opinions about their own budgeting decisions as if they were uncontested truths, without addressing the subjective nature of answering such questions. </p>

<p>So - I basically have two related questions:</p>

<p>As a community, how do we make sure we understand the asker's criteria, or how do we handle opinion based questions with no criteria? Or, if they asker clearly has different critera than we do, how do we still write an answer that's in their context?</p>

<p>Secondly, how do we handle balancing two things that sometimes compete: directly answering a question, versus giving advice on why it may or may not be a ""good"" idea to do the thing that's being asked about?</p>

<p>The simplest solution is to vote to close the question as unclear.</p>

<p>A more helpful solution is to ask the OP. There is the danger of getting pulled into a financial counselling session, but as participation is voluntary, people can always stop interacting once it stops being productive. And they can still vote to close the question at any time.</p>

<p>Sometimes, older and wiser folk can anticipate what makes for good criteria better than the OP. This can go into the answer as part of its context-setting.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In the end, the only good reason to contribute answers is to be helpful.</p>

<p>As you note, personal finance involves value judgements. If the choice between cars is 'cheap and workable' vs 'not so cheap, but wow', then the helpful thing would be to bring out other factors that the OP might have overlooked: <em>How long would it delay their rainy-day fund? How long will the 'wow' last? Can they really afford the wow car? Is the workable car really workable?</em> and so on.</p>

<p>What makes a good answer to an <em>is this a good idea</em> question? Well, the OP asked because they are torn by the choice. A good answer would try to expose why the choice is so hard, and provide additional factors to consider that push the answer more firmly either way.</p>

<p>If I could wave that magic wand and get members to adhere to this guidance, I would. This answer should be part of our tour and general FAQ regarding the stack. But. The devil, in this case, is in the implementation. When that ""should I"" question pops up, is it closed for the OP to update or will a kind member make this change via edit. As a community, we run the risk of being accused of being too pedantic and potentially lose the new member who otherwise might have become long-term. </p>

<p>Now, back to the title question - we do have the 'vote to close' choices which include opinion-based. So, the concern shared here is not so much a dramatic shift in policy, but a plea for a bit more adherence to the policy already in place. (correct me if I am wrong). </p>

<p>By using comments to ask questions to clarify. And perhaps more important, to delay answering until the question is solid. I observe a tendency for members to post answers well before simple things are made clear. A tax question for the which the country is unknown, 3 great US-centric answers, and an hour later, OP states she is in India. I suppress my urge to just delete those posted answers, as that would seem unkind, but, you get the idea.   </p>

<p>While strongly valid, this is not a new concern. As a community, I don't think we have consensus on this. I believe that sometimes ""How do I....."" really deserves an answer ""You really don't want to do that, here's why...."" and yet, that answer isn't quite right, and subject to closure. </p>

We can 'feature' this, so it gains more attention, but in general, these issues of a shift in how we handle questions take time, twice. First, for the active members to agree this is good, but then a bit more for the 'enforcement' part to become a routine.   </p>

2840,26769,,1,,1,,11,0,0,,,Community Promotion Ads — 2020,<discussion><community-ads>,CC BY-SA 4.0,"<p>2020 has come! But… oops, where did the time go? It’s already March! Belated as it is, it’s time for a refresh of <strong>Community Promotion Ads</strong>!</p>

<h3>What are Community Promotion Ads?</h3>

<p>Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.</p>

<h3>Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?</h3>

<p>This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:</p>

<ul>
<li>financial blogs and websites</li>
<li>cool events or conferences</li>
<li>anything else your community would genuinely be interested in</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal is for future visitors to find out about <em>the stuff your community deems important</em>. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are <em>relevant to your own community's interests</em>, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. </p>

<h3>Why do we reset the ads every year?</h3>

<p>Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.</p>

<p>The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>

<p>The answers you post to this question <em>must</em> conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>All answers should be in the exact form of:</p>

<pre><code>[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]

   [1]: http://image-url
   [2]: http://clickthrough-url 
</code></pre>

<p>Please <strong>do not add anything else to the body of the post</strong>. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.</p></li>
<li><p>The question must always be tagged with the magic <a href=""/questions/tagged/community-ads"" class=""post-tag moderator-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;community-ads&#39;"" rel=""tag"">community-ads</a> tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Image requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li>The image that you create must be 300 x 250 pixels, or double that if high DPI.</li>
<li>Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)</li>
<li>Must be GIF or PNG</li>
<li>No animated GIFs</li>
<li>Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB</li>
<li>If the background of the image is white or partially white, there must be a 1px border (2px if high DPI) surrounding it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Score Threshold</h3>

<p>There is a <strong>minimum score threshold</strong> an answer must meet (currently <strong>6</strong>) before it will be shown on the main site.</p>

<p>You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/2840"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Very, very few people are ""Fabrege egg"" rich and no one would advocate eating them.  The are art work that ranges in costs of tens of millions of dollars.  I would venture to say that, if that is what you are looking for, they are probably not on the site.  Much like Bill Gates or Bjarne Stroustrup will not make contributions to stack overflow.  Even if they did, they would probably be down voted.</p>

<p>While buying a home is a dream of many young people, would you consider owning a home outright being wealthy?  What about purchasing a new car for cash?  What about having sufficient retirement assets so that one can enjoy retirement?  By enjoying living and taking care of medical bills, a bit of travel, a late model car, and of course enough gifts for the grand kids.</p>

<p>For me, those are the things that I want.  The number does not matter as much as what it can buy.  I suspect JTP defines his number similarly.  </p>

<p>There are people on money that are well on their way to, or have hit their number so they ""can afford nice things"".  </p>

<p>Why would they be on this site?  Because of a desire to teach.  Perhaps they had help early in life and want to do the same for others.  Perhaps they want to help others avoid the mistakes that they made.  Perhaps they want to dissuade people from the false crap that goes around like day trading and FOREX.</p>

  Supposing, entirely hypothetically ;), that a major Western government had taken on massive future debts (by spontaneously giving away vast amounts of money) immediately before a significant recession.</p>

<p>I wrote it up and was about to tag it with <code>economics</code> when I saw the notes on that tag.
This definitely isn't speculative, since I'm asking about what standard expectations would be, not what will actually <em>happen</em>.</p>

<p>But the tag also asks that questions pertain to personal situations. I am asking in order to apply the answer to my personal situation ... but the question seems decidely not-individual to me.</p>

<p>Am I right in thinking this would be closed as off-topic?

<p>I find this assertion curious. </p>

<p>""'<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_dismal_science"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The dismal science' is a derogatory alternative name for economics coined by the Victorian historian Thomas Carlyle in the 19th century</a>."" Part of the reason for the adjective is that unlike physical science which builds upon agreed facts, economics offers theories which simply fail from time to time. If there were a 'standard expectation', there would be no jokes about economists needing three hands for a typical conversation. I've seen too many examples of policies that have failed due to differing opinions. </p>

<p>Personally, I'd welcome pushing the boundary a bit, and letting such a question remain, with a careful monitoring of the activity. I think such questions, if kept on track, can be useful. Unfortunately, that would take a bit more effort, as it would require a change to the ""on topic"" guidance. I offer this last thought as a member, not a mod. </p>

The note telling me it was closed as off-topic says </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Questions seeking product, service recommendations or other off-site resources are off-topic because they tend to become obsolete quickly. Instead, describe your situation and the specific problem you're trying to solve.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After explaining that transferwise  doesn’t work for the currency pair, the initial draft <em>did</em> ask if there’s “a service” that would work, perhaps that’s why it was closed? I’ve now revised it to remove that phrasing, but if that is the reason it would feel extremely ungenerous - the initial draft already described the situation and the specific problem, the idea that it must be “a service” was never the key thing.</p>

<p>Or are questions about this kind of thing just inherently off-topic? I wouldn’t have thought so, as it’s a matter of how to effectively manage my (wife’s) personal finances. I don’t see anything under the “what topics can I ask about?” or “what should I avoid asking?” help sections that seems to cover it, and the only relevant previous meta discussion I found <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2152/how-to-handle-the-influx-of-questions-on-cheap-ways-to-transfer-money-from-curre"">is five years old and has no answer</a>.</p>

2896,10997,,2,,2,2207,,,0,,,,,CC BY-SA 4.0,"<p>In this question, I have identified six classes of questions that are regularly closed as off-topic because of the &quot;product or service recommendations&quot; reason.  I think too many of these questions really should not be closed.  Without making judgments on the individual questions listed as examples above, I'd like to offer my opinion on how to handle these six types of questions.  But before I do, I'd like to offer a principle that I use when reviewing questions:</p>
<p><strong>A question is on-topic or off-topic based on what the question is, not on what the correct answer is.</strong>  Askers ask questions that they don't know the answer to.  As you review a question, if you think you know the answer and you think the question is off-topic, ask yourself if you would still think the question was off-topic if the answer was different.  If you would probably change your opinion if the answer was different, then you should probably leave the question open.</p>
<p>Now, let's look at the six types of questions being discussed here:</p>
<h1>Should be on-topic (open)</h1>
<ul>
<li><p><em>&quot;How do I find this information?&quot;</em> Certainly, we answer questions for people seeking information all the time.  If we are able to provide information, we should also be able to help people learn how to find information for themselves, teaching them to fish in addition to giving them the fish.  This should be on-topic.  Yes, occasionally the answer will require a pointer to a commercial site.  This does not have the same problem as a true <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2010/11/23/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/"">shopping question</a>.  The question is not asking for opinions about which service is the best, which changes over time.  It is simply seeking information.  The question asker doesn't know if the info is available from government websites, corporate websites, community websites, or private websites, and often the question reviewer doesn't know, either.  These should be on-topic regardless.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>&quot;How do I accomplish this task?&quot;</em> In this type of question, the asker needs to accomplish a task, and doesn't know what needs to be done.  In some instances, the task can be accomplished for free using government resources.  In other instances, professional help (accountants or lawyers) is required.  Still in other instances, it is best done by utilizing a paid commercial service.  These should be on-topic.  Now, if the question asker already knows how to do the task and is simply looking for a recommendation on the best commercial service to utilize, that is different.  But in general, these should be allowed.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>&quot;How do I use this particular service?&quot;</em> This is similar to &quot;How do I accomplish this task&quot; questions.  We <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/q/127/10997"">do allow questions on software usage</a>, and these questions should be on-topic even if they are about using a website/webapp instead of a downloadable/installable piece of software.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Should be off-topic (close)</h1>
<ul>
<li><p><em>&quot;&quot;Which is the best product/service?&quot;</em> This is actually the type of question that founder Jeff Atwood was talking about in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2010/11/23/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/"">his blog post</a>, and should be closed as off-topic for the reasons discussed there.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>&quot;Is this particular service any good?&quot;</em> This is a little different than a simple shopping question.  Instead of asking for recommendations among lots of different services, it is simply looking for a review of one particular service.  However, these ultimately suffer from the same problems as the standard shopping question.  Reviews are opinion-based and will change over time as the service itself changes and competition changes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>It depends</h1>
<ul>
<li><em>&quot;Where can I get a better deal than what I'm currently getting?&quot;</em> This is a gray area.  According to our <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">on-topic help page</a>, &quot;Strategies for saving more money&quot; related to &quot;Spending Wisely&quot; are on-topic.  However, these questions are often simply asking for recommendations for another service.  These could go either way, and it really depends on the merits of the individual question.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>In conclusion, I would ask question reviewers to think about these issues before clicking &quot;product or service recommendations&quot; as the close reason.  When you incorrectly close a question and cite a reason that doesn't fit, it confuses everyone.  If the question should be closed for another reason, then select the correct reason.  But if you are closing a question because you think it is a product or service recommendation question, compare it to my list here and see which category it really belongs to.  You might find on further analysis that it really should be kept open.</p>

2898,20480,187,1,2899,1,,74,1,0,,,Advice needed on asking question about stock splits,<discussion><closed-questions>,CC BY-SA 4.0,"<h3>Background</h3>
<p>I posted a question that was not well-received: <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/129819"">When am I entitled to participate in a stock split? — record date, split date, ex date</a></p>
<p>Shortly after posting the question above, I posted a second question: <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/q/129824"">How is the &quot;record date&quot; relevant in stock splits?</a>. This question was also poorly received, and was quickly closed as a duplicate of the first. (Note - also deleted by its author. /JTP)</p>
<p>In the meantime, I tried to read as much about stock splits as possible. I learned much that I did not know about when I posted those questions. With hindsight, I agree with the assessment of a user who said that the first question was &quot;overly complicated&quot; and &quot;jibber jabber about pay date, ex date, record date and comparison with stock and cash dividends&quot;. I now understand what the &quot;pre-split&quot; price is, and when stocks start to trade at a &quot;post-split&quot; price.</p>
<p>However, even after spending more time learning about stock splits, I still do not understand the &quot;record date&quot;. The answer to the first question does not mention anything about the &quot;record date&quot;. I also believe that future answers are unlikely to address the &quot;record date&quot; due to other glaring problems in the first question. This leads me to believe that the second question is not a duplicate of the first. I have since edited the second question to hopefully emphasize its relevance to personal finance.</p>
<h3>I need advice</h3>
<p>Current situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>The two questions I asked about stock splits were poorly received (I now see why, at least for the first one)</li>
<li>I want to ask a question specifically about the meaning of the &quot;record date&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>What should I do now? To the best of my ability, I want to avoid posting further &quot;nonsense&quot;. Should I post a new question that essentially repeats the second question? Will the moderators consider reopening the second question? Or are such questions unsuitable for this site?</p>

2899,10997,,2,,2,2898,,,10,,,,,CC BY-SA 4.0,"<p>Your questions are not bad questions. They are about a subject that a lot of people wonder about. I think some reviewers were making weird assumptions about your motives (looking for a way to scam the system), and the only answer to your first question essentially says, “It just works; don’t worry about it,” which of course is not a very satisfying answer.</p>
<p>That having been said, your first question does ask about the record date specifically, so the second question does appear to be essentially a duplicate to me.</p>
<p>I think you need to be patient with your first question. Yes, you got a downvote and some rude comments, but you got some upvotes, too. You left a comment on the lone answer asking for more information, which is appropriate. And more enlightening answers could be added at anytime.</p>

The problem with &quot;otc-stocks&quot;, &quot;otc-securities&quot;, &quot;otc-markets&quot; is that they are not US-specific, and not specifically about &quot;OTCBB, OTCQX, OTCQB, and OTC Pink&quot;.

2905,67285,,2,,0,2063,,,2,,,,,CC BY-SA 4.0,"<p>I would offer a similar  answer as JTP presented.  The stock market and some real estate allowed me to hit my number so I was able to  retire in my early 50's.  I'm by no means wealthy but I have maintained my lifestyle - I can have anything that I want but fortunately I don't want much :-).  My investments include some annuities and fully paid long term care insurance so about the only thing that might screw it up is ending up on a tube :-O</p>
<p>I've been involved in the stock market for the past 40 years, (retail not professional).  For the past 20 years, I have traded as well.  Although I had a few outlandish years in 2008 and 2009  when I was net short, my goal has been to augment my income and maintain my net worth. This is a full time endeavor which I enjoy.  When the market is volatile, you won't see as much of me on Stack.  So why am I here?</p>
<p>If you come across me on Personal Finance, I answer almost every option question posed.  I have utilized options for 40+ years.  As JTP wrote about himself, &quot;I enjoy the subject and enjoy helping people.&quot; In fact, helping people also helps me.  Options are complex securities and working out some of the situations asked about and explaining the complexities makes me focus and helps to keep me sharp.  I'd compare it to making an effort to speak a foreign language so that you retain fluency.</p>
<p>Another aspect of this is that although I'm full time with the stock market, I don't have to stare at quotes all day long.  I determine what I want to do, set my price alarms in the morning and if they fire during the day I either take action or reset them.  Often, there's a lot of time available. I read the news, read a book, and as a change of pace, I put in some time on Stack. Oddly, changing focus seems to clear my mind.</p>
<p>You indicated that if you could, you would never go to work and would probably spend all day on your yacht with friends drinking champagne and eating Fabergé eggs.  Apart from the fact that Fabergé eggs aren't edible, that's your dream.  I don't drink, I don't eat eggs and I can't afford a yacht so we're not likely to cross paths at the marina.  But if you ask about something market related and I have experience in that area, we'll meet on Stack.</p>

2909,366,,2,,3,2908,,,1,,,,,CC BY-SA 4.0,"<p>In general we don't allow questions asking for help on how to commit crimes in the future.
If you've done something stupid in the past and want help resolving the situation it's different, even if it was potentially criminal. Such a question is not &quot;not nice&quot;, if you'll excuse the double negative.</p>
<p>I deleted your comment responding to a flag, and I did it for two main reasons (although I took about 2 seconds to do it so much of the reasons were subconscious or only being fleshed out now!):</p>
<p>Firstly, comments on answers are to ask for more information or to suggest improvements. I guess you can argue that fundamental disagreements are a suggestion for improvement even if there's no way the answerer will change their post, and sometimes such comments do survive for the benefit of future readers. But getting into an argument about a subjective and sensitive point of view is unlikely to survive regardless of how politely it's expressed.</p>
<p>Secondly, it was rightly flagged as &quot;rude and abusive&quot;. At the very least &quot;You have some intelligence issues&quot; is inappropriate. Accusing them of trying to scam someone is also not actually justified by the question; they say they naively thought the money was coming from the &quot;sugar daddy&quot; and you have no evidence to the contrary, just opinion.</p>
<p>You've also posted an answer. Those get much more respect than comments but they still have to answer the question and they still have to be nice. Your answer does a decent job of explaining the hurdles to fixing the problem, but I thought &quot;you are again just as bad as the scammer&quot; crossed the line and I've edited it to &quot;you are also culpable&quot;. Moderating your answer was a more finely balanced decision than your comment.</p>
<p>Finally, bear in mind that we generally moderate things that are flagged or that we come across. We often won't have time to review absolutely everything on a question at the same time and sometimes even if we see something borderline in normal browsing we might not touch it until someone flags. So just because one thing is removed but another survives is not automatic evidence that the latter is ok. However in this case as I outlined above, I think the question is acceptable for the site.</p>

<li><p>Move all the &quot;puts&quot; and &quot;calls&quot; questions into &quot;put-options&quot; and &quot;call-options&quot;.</p>
<p>Reasoning: All &quot;puts&quot; and &quot;calls&quot; questions are currently about options. It makes little sense to have multiple tags that deal with exactly the same topic. I don't think tag synonyms are appropriate, because there are legitimate uses of &quot;puts&quot; and &quot;calls&quot; outside options.</p>

<li><p>Delete the &quot;puts&quot; and &quot;calls&quot; tags.</p>
<p>Reasoning: The generic &quot;puts&quot; and &quot;calls&quot; tags should be deleted because they are too tempting to use for options. For uses outside options, there is currently no demand so deletion is safe. To avoid the use of &quot;puts&quot; and &quot;calls&quot; in the future, instrument-specific tags could be created when the need arises (e.g. &quot;put-warrants&quot;, &quot;callable-bonds&quot;, etc.).</p>

2933,10997,,2,,4,2932,,,10,,,,,CC BY-SA 4.0,"<p>There are a couple of issues going on.</p>
<p>First, it is important for you to realize that questions asking for product or service recommendations are off-topic on this site, as well as most Stack Exchange sites.  On this site, that is generally interpreted to include asking for recommendations on things like books, websites, and other educational materials.  Your question specifically asks for a &quot;resource (book or otherwise),&quot; and so it was likely to get closed.</p>
<p>If you have a specific question about mortgages or even about something that you had read in the book you referenced, that would certainly be on-topic.  But asking for a general &quot;What books can you recommend to teach me X?&quot; is off-topic.</p>
<p>Normally, questions that are off-topic are closed long before they are deleted.  When this happens, a notice appears informing you the reason that your question was closed, and you would have the opportunity to respond via the comments or edit the question to try to bring it on-topic.  Unfortunately, a moderator decided to delete your open question with no explanation.  By doing this, he hid it from view, leaving you with no explanation, and has prevented you the opportunity to comment on or edit your question.  Normally this is only done when rude or offensive language has been used, or in cases of spam.

<p>As we say goodbye to the old year and welcome the new one, we have <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=%22year+in+moderation%22+is%3Aquestion"">a tradition of sharing moderation stats for the past 12 months</a>.</p>
<p>As most of you here are aware, sites on the Stack Exchange network are moderated somewhat differently to other sites on the web:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We designed the Stack Exchange network engine to be mostly self-regulating, in that we amortize the overall moderation cost of the system across thousands of teeny-tiny slices of effort contributed by regular, everyday users.<br />
-- <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/"">A Theory of Moderation</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That doesn't eliminate the need for having <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/11/21/our-theory-of-moderation-re-visited/"">moderators</a> altogether, but it does mean that the bulk of moderation work is carried out by regular folks. Every bit of time and effort y'all contribute to the site gives you access to more privileges you can use to help in this effort, all of which produce a cumulative effect that makes a big difference.</p>
<p>So as we welcome 2021, and in keeping with tradition, let us look back at what we accomplished as a community... by looking at some <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pU1Al.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>exciting</em> stats</a>.

2962,20154,,1,,12,,183,2,4,,,How can we help better people with no financial literacy?,<discussion>,CC BY-SA 4.0,"<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> I would like to see this site start to become a better and more visible resource for people at the very beginning of the learning curve on financial literacy.  Any ideas on how to achieve this?</p>
<p>I recently had an experience that gave me pause.  I was going through a fast food drive through and the woman handling my order was asking some questions about my credit card, which is linked to a popular investment firm.  I explained how the cash back rewards can be directed to things like an IRA with the investment firm.  She did not know what an IRA was, and, unfortunately, the short time at a drive through window is not enough to educate someone on something so important.  It would be useful though to be able to point someone like that to a &quot;Quick Start Guide&quot; to financial literacy.</p>
<p>I looked at our FAQ answer here on Meta (<a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2376/frequently-answered-questions-by-topic?cb=1"">Frequently Answered Questions (by topic)</a>), but even that makes assumptions about basic financial literacy.  For example, we have a section for questions related to IRAs and 401(k)s but we don't have the most basic questions: what do you need to do to prepare for retirement, what are an IRA and a 401(k), and why should you care about them (if you are in the US of course)?  We do have one question about what an IRA is on the SE site itself but it's asked in the context of whether it's appropriate for an Indian citizen, which would cause many (most?) to skip over it.</p>
<p>In short, I feel like we've gotten into a situation where there are no questions about these basics, which self reinforces: people don't find this SE site when searching for basic questions like &quot;What is an IRA?&quot; so they don't find it to ask the questions.</p>
<p>I'm also dissatisfied with the top resources on financial literacy (from a google search for &quot;financial literacy guide&quot;):</p>
<ol>
<li><a href=""https://www.investopedia.com/guide-to-financial-literacy-4800530"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.investopedia.com/guide-to-financial-literacy-4800530</a> : Jumps straight from How to Create a Budget to How to Start Investing without any significant discussion of saving for retirement</li>
<li><a href=""https://www.annuity.org/financial-literacy/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.annuity.org/financial-literacy/</a> : Has minimal discussion of retirement saving before (predictably) stating that annuities are the answer</li>

<p>Without resorting to product / service recommendations, how can we start building a worthwhile (and discoverable) body of questions and answers about the basics of financial literacy?</p>

<p>The reason for closing this question was that it is offtopic because it requires an off site resource that would change quickly.</p>
<p>This is not correct because the universe of answers do not require that, and assuming they do seems to be based in ignorance and trepidation around anonymous financing, which isn't necessarily what the question is about. As anonymous has multiple contexts in the non profit world.</p>
<p>Neither of those concerns change reality that this is an answerable personal finance question that fits the moderation guidelines of this site.</p>
<p>I've incorporated benign uses of cryptocurrencies in personal finance questions and answers since 2013 or so, and it is clear that there is a general anathema towards cryptocurrencies in personal finance forums. It is also clear that the consensus has shifted towards the realities I presented nearly a decade ago, which the same and different people with high reputation disagreed with when I originally presented them. This is another one of those, and I also have worked with non-profit lawyers, tax lawyers and various kinds of registered charities regarding cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>Edit to bump: four votes obtained. When I think about the active people on this site there aren't really that many, 5 of them had voted to close, 4 additional including myself have voted to reopen, so I'm really not sure how many interested parties there are here.</p>

The asker notes this in the question itself, and the accepted answer is by a user essentially advising them how to achieve this.</p>
<p><strong>I don't believe that such questions or answers should be entertained here.</strong> While not explicitly disallowed by the Stack Exchange network's Code of Conduct nor technically illegal, hosting such morally grey content could easily open Money.SE and the entire Stack Exchange network up to a trial in the court of public opinion, the consequences of which are unlikely to be favourable.</p>

The OP apparently asks a question about whether or not they can buy things for themselves with their company's money, and the clear legal answer to that is &quot;no&quot; - I have now <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/a/135384/366"">posted an answer</a> to explain this.</p>
<p>The accepted answer, and the OP in an edit to their question, make it clear they are actually talking about ways to dress up expenses that are really personal as business ones. That's illegal, even if you would never get caught.</p>
<p>If the question was genuinely asking about legal but morally questionable activity, then I would be in favour of keeping it for the reasons Ben gives.</p>

2966,10997,,2,,8,2964,,,7,,,,,CC BY-SA 4.0,"<p>The problem with this line of thinking is: Whose version of morality are you (or the moderators) going to enforce?</p>
<p>Tax laws are just that: laws.  If something is &quot;technically legal,&quot; then it is, in fact, legal.  Taxes are a legal obligation; we wouldn't pay taxes if we weren't required.  So if someone is asking how to avoid taxes in a &quot;technically legal&quot; way, how is that immoral?  Am I doing something immoral when I contribute to my HSA and take a tax deduction?  How about when I contribute to a Roth IRA and never pay tax on any of the investment earnings?  Is that immoral?</p>
<p>If you think that the accepted answer is incorrect, then you have several options at your disposal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Downvote the answer</li>
<li>Leave a comment explaining the error</li>
<li>Write your own correct answer</li>
</ul>
<p>Users have done all of these things.</p>
<p>I do not think that moderators should be deleting answers that they simply don't agree with, and I certainly do not think that moderators should be deleting questions just because they don't like some of the answers.  Our moderators have some very important duties, but using mod powers to judge the correctness of answers is not one of them.</p>
<p>As for my opinion on <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/a/135198/10997"">the answer we are talking about</a>, I think TomTom makes some great points.  I don't know anything about UK tax law, but of course, there is grey area, and I don't think TomTom is sugar-coating it; he repeatedly says that you can get in trouble with the government, and recommends consulting an accountant.</p>

<li>Do their comments on answers imply that they are looking only for the answer that says &quot;yes you may do this&quot; or &quot;this is how to get away with it&quot;?</li>
<li>Do their responses to comments on their question double down on their looking for a way to cheat?</li>

2968,44232,,2,,12,2962,,,1,,,,,CC BY-SA 4.0,"<p>Fundamentally I think the problem is one of scope - for all the good it does, SE is not exactly the best method of doing what you are asking about.</p>
<p>SE is really designed as a repository of information, built over time by specific questions. I see the value of closing items as duplicate, and often do so, but for the most under-informed on financial literacy, what really is needed is a specifically 'personal' touch. Building up vast libraries of information seems more aligned with technical materials rather than low-level 'barely-technical' financial basics.</p>
<p>So paradoxically I think money.SE adds the most value to someone's life when it answers a very specific question for them, but at the same time, the most efficient use of SE in general is with broad-strokes technical info to help someone capable of learning and seeking out answers already.</p>
<p>Even some of the really good ol' standby answers on this site, like <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/q/1625/44232"">Best way to start investing, for a young person just starting their career?</a>, will only add value to someone at the stage where they are actively looking for answers, but the dearth of financial literacy in society is a problem that starts with gradeschool education. People don't ask questions to get answers they aren't aware they need or want.</p>
<p>'Money' can be a terrifying subject, and it is not surprising that (a) people find it hard to trust information that isn't directly responding to their immediate questions [rather than sifting through broader answers not 100% applicable to them]; and (b) people frequently get duped by questionable resources. I have often lamented that a niche career in truly basic financial literacy education [particularly getting into tax or other more technical areas] is a really hard thing to make money from compared with the value of a similar education applied to other areas [corporate finance, etc.].</p>

<p>Fundamental personal finance knowledge is exactly that, it's the very basics of the topic. Stack Exchange is predicated on users having that basic knowledge before coming here. It's like asking why universities don't teach the periodic table or the colour wheel - the students should know this, and much more besides, before they enrolled at all.</p>

As is often the case, there's a fuzzy middle. Questions about investing in a specific stock are off topic. But if the question is really a general one, one for which avoiding the stock name still leaves a valid question, it may be fine.</p>
<p>Often, a question might start to be voted to close, but that minor edit is enough.</p>
<p>Explanation of short float, for instance, would be on topic, as it's of interest to an investor.</p>

<p>[Explanation]</p>
<p>I come originally from Stack Overlow, where the rules have changed such that any question which smacks of recommendation or being opinion-based gets very, very quickly shut down (sigh! I have been round long enough to remember when we had a <code>books</code> tag there).</p>
<p>I am not sure how it is here, although a search for <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/search?q=recommend"">recommendation</a>  produces over 2,500 results. I also don't see my topic covered in <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2376/frequently-answered-questions-by-topic"">FAQ answered questions by topic</a>.</p>
<p>However, some friends asked me to ask here, as they are too lazy to set up an account (and argue which would). Despite that, I really want to hep them, but I don't want to lose what little rep I have to downvotes.</p>
<hr />
<p>[Question] three friends who lost their employment during Covid times are discussing ways to generate some income. Two of them are for on-lien selling, most likely drop shipping on eBay, Aamzon, etc. The third is disparaging, and says that that seam has been mined dry long ago and the margins must be wafer-tin by now.</p>
<p>Is there anyway that I can post an on-tropic question to help them?</p>
<ul>
<li>ask for any source of data on profit margins?
<ul>
<li>per site?</li>
<li>per type of item? E.g do electronics have a better margin than pet toys? Do high price items have a bigger margin? I suspect that eBay might provide some data, which might be extrapolatable to other sites.</li>
<li>are any niches currently under active, seller-wise?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ask for guides  &amp; tutorials? This sounds like opinion-based to me. Also, I expect that such things might not age well, although they could give good general guidelines</li>
<li>what alternatives are there for them to generate income? (probably too broad)</li>
</ul>
<p>Since drop shipping form CHina has a lead time, it might be necessary to purchase in advance, but that obviously has ramifications.</p>
<p>Ok, I think than you get the gist of the nub of the essence of the  crux of the direction of the drift of my potential question.</p>
<ol>
<li>is that sort of thing on-topic at all?</li>
<li>is the above roughly acceptable? If not, how can I make is acceptable?</li>

Ultimately, the TLDR version is &quot;Can I ask about profit margins of items I wish to sell online?&quot; Right? This seems to be a bit off-topic from person finance as we define it here.
Others may feel differently, and encourage you to post the question. Keep in mind, the risk to your rep is minimal, a vote up is 10, but down is -2. I appreciate the pre-ask here, but keep in mind, our meta traffic is pretty low. The same hour on Money.SE might have gotten 100 views by now.

<p>This is an example why I use SE about 10 times less than 5 years ago.   I basically realized there are people who just talk and answer questions and for whatever reason, they just don't get it.  That means a lot of answers that are out there are wrong or partly wrong and users have to decipher what is what.</p>
<p>I have people commenting on my understanding of exchanges and company listings when I might be one of a handful of people in the US that has expertise in exchange networks, rules, and trading.   I have seen everything and written every rule imaginable for all US exchanges... especially NYSE.</p>
<p>So when a high rep member of the site comes on trying to diss my comments and discount them when I am the expert.   Yea makes me laugh but signals the issue with SE.   Most sites are a matter or gaining popular opinion, not having the right answer.   Please tell me that I am wrong.</p>

<p>One issue is comments. <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2602/the-intent-and-purpose-of-comments"">The Intent and Purpose of Comments</a> made my view pretty clear. Simply put, most issues arise from comments as opposed to the actually Q or A. (Again, in my opinion) comments should auto-evaporate in X days, say 3. If in that time, a comment thread runs 10+, it should auto-move to a room.</p>
<p>The other issue is that technically, wrong answers should be voted down, not flagged, not deleted. I've seen factually incorrect answers get voted up, and I've used my own answer to counter it, only to be told that I was simply offering my own 'opinion.' I thought I was pretty clear in my own mind the distinction between opinion and fact.</p>
<p>I acknowledge that your issue may have occurred anyway, but the current news event regarding one stock has spawned a flood of questions, many of which I'd declare 'bad'.</p>
<p>In the end I can't say that you're wrong. I'd prefer that for fact-seeking questions we eliminate factually incorrect answers. Of course, not every question can or should be fact-based. Advice often depends on risk tolerance, which isn't always definable with any precision.</p>

An answer containing some technically correct statements but incorrect or opinionated conclusions that will be the focus of a naive reader, is even worse.</strong></p>
<p>The flood of GME questions coming in seem to be largely coming from those who prior to last week had never heard of a 'short', and may have only basic understanding (if that) of investing in general. That warrants 2 things for a good answer, in my opinion:</p>
<p>(1) Inserting caution to the reader where risk exists or is implied by either the question or your answer itself; and</p>
<p>(2) Keeping things less technical unless needed.</p>
<p>Your answer, in my opinion [though I hadn't seen it before you asked this on Meta], was not great. In particular, a broad sweeping statement like this is relatively foolhardy, as the finite conclusion given:</p>
<p>&quot;Stock splits have two basic effects on market:
Stock will go up way higher than market average when announced.
Stock will go up way higher than market average when implemented.&quot;</p>
<p>I don't even care about whether you could show evidence of this being on average the case historically [though you gave no such evidence nor even referred to its existence, assuming that your <em>not even stated and <strong>definitely not provable to the reader</strong></em> expertise should attract the reverence of belief] [and, keeping in mind correlation vs causation, and stock split announcements occurring alongside other stated plans from management etc.].</p>
<p><strong>The fact that you use definitive clauses with no caveat makes it a bad answer, plain and simple.</strong></p>
<p>It is true that SE is less good on technical areas where accuracy is hard to self-identify, because the crowd-sourcing vote system might sway a less informed user to upvote something incorrect. But that isn't what's going on here.</p>

I think it isn't very legal, but since the law can't cover all and every possible cases, there's always a way to circumvent it into being technically legal.</p>
<p>A very, very sketchy example would be: imagine a rule that forbids you from killing. Then you incinerate someone, you claim that &quot;I did not kill them, I merely burnt them&quot;. Technically right, but... yeah, it's stretching the laws.</p>
<p>I honestly don't like that answer that much, but I think Ben Miller adressed it well in their answer on this meta: the answer says that it can get you in trouble, so it was more of a factual answer for the most curious ones, although it won't prevent anyone from applying it.</p>

<p>Even though it doesn't substitute a lawyer, you can learn something from asking. Which reminds me of that one person who asked how someone can possibly get caught from using that other chemical that can kill anyone with merely a few drop, nearly a dozen months later, which gives you plenty of time to &quot;disappear&quot;: maybe they planned to kill someone, maybe they didn't, but we all learnt something from reading it.</p>

<p>I've complained about commenters and commenting on this site before and agree that it's a monstrous flaw to the design of this site, particularly for topics like this where very few of the answers have a citeable factual answer like, &quot;that goes on line 5 of IRS schedule C.&quot; or whatever. In the case of code, while there can be opinions about mechanisms, the answer either achieves a repeatable result or it doesn't. I wouldn't blame you for no longer contributing; I know I've found myself abandoning half written answers because it's not worth the all the caveats to avoid the inevitable comment battle, that will still happen anyway.</p>
<p>Ultimately, people are free to disagree, but the issue, as far as I can tell, is this system is intended to be well considered answers written in response to well considered questions, not a discussion. There are a lot of discussion boards, this isn't one. If a person disagrees with an answer their recourse is to vote the answer down, not write a disagreeing or disparaging comment and request supporting documentation (not simply out of genuine interest, but as some quasi-substantiation of their disagreement) . This is further compounded by the fact that, again, by nature of the topic almost all of the questions will have at least partially opinionated answers.</p>
<p>I'd argue that almost all of the questions regarding GameStop over the last couple weeks are not well considered and, I'd go a step farther and assert that most of the people asking the question don't actually care what the answer is and probably barely even care about the question they've asked. It would be interesting to know how many question askers even check back after a day or week.  I'm a little surprised there haven't been questions asking about suing Citadel for &quot;being in bed with Robinhood&quot; or some other outrageous claim/situation.</p>
<p>With all of that said, the answer you wrote there has very little to do with the question asked regardless of whether or not there is data to support that split companies tend to outperform the market after the split. The person asking the question has the obvious misconception that changing the number of shares outstanding doesn't change anything else and would have some immediate impact on the short sellers (to this end why wouldn't every company just reverse-split every time a single share is shorted to squeeze them out).</p>
<p>I agree completely that the system is flawed and I still contribute here, though much much less than before, because I think it helps my writing and I haven't found a better outlet for that practice.</p>

You should know enough to know when you don't know enough to make a determination.  :)</p>
<p>Of course, with great power comes great responsibility.  It is good that you recognize that you now wield the dup-hammer, and you should only use it when you are confident.  (I would argue that you should always be careful with votes-to-close, even if you are not the deciding vote.)</p>
<p>For me personally, I rarely vote to close as duplicate; not necessarily because I'm worried about being the lone, deciding close vote, but that I'm generally feeling charitable about keeping questions open and letting users answer new questions with new answers.  I only close as duplicate when it is truly an almost exact duplicate; similar questions are not good enough to close for me.  For a great article on the concept of duplicate questions, see Jeff Atwood's blog post &quot;<a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2010/11/16/dr-strangedupe-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-duplication/"">Dr. Strangedupe: Or, How I learned to stop worrying and love duplication</a>.&quot;  In it, he defends his realization that it is okay, and even preferable, to leave multiple similar questions open, and that trying to micromanage the site to contain one, canonical question for each topic is not possible.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I don't feel that the gold badge dup-hammer ability necessarily needs to go away, but I agree that those of us with the ability need to take the responsibility seriously and limit when we use it.</p>

Nearly all questions on this site are quite interrelated in terms of the broad subject matter, enough so that I would say anyone with that level of proven participation should be trusted to have the core ability to detect something to be closed [and where you don't feel comfortable with such a decision for a particular question, hopefully you are aware of that limitation and would not choose to do so].</p>
<p>The only benefit to the change you are proposing, in my opinion, would be that it would grant you the ability to 'throw in a close vote', where you feel it should be closed, but not confidently enough to hammer it. Seems like an edge case resolved by just holding back your vote in that case, with the only net cost being some questions might take a bit longer to close if your vote would have been the 'regular decider'.</p>

<p>I feel as though recently there have been lots of posts tagged &quot;credit score&quot; that are not also tagged with a location. I have commented on many of them asking the user to indicate where they are, but oftentimes they get answered with a US-based answer (which, to be fair, based on purely statistical probability is probably what the asker wanted) and then the OP never comes back to indicate where they actually are - leaving the question, and answer, untagged as to location and potentially confusing other non-US readers in the future.</p>
<p>Have we given up attempting to find a solution to these tagging issues? It may be my confirmation bias but I don't seem to notice the same issues occurring anything like as much these days with tax or other location-specific questions, despite the lack of any actual concrete solution having been implemented.</p>

<p>Having reviewed the edit history, answer author DJClayworth start off his answer by making a rather highly charged statement.  His very next line is, &quot;I'm sorry I had to write that sentence.&quot;</p>
<p>We can be sympathetic to the question asker who apparently acted out of ignorance.  I accept DJClayworth's claim that he felt compelled that he &quot;had to&quot; make that uncomfortable statement.</p>
<p>A mod removed the first two lines of the answer.
Not only did the mod do so, but the mod also edited some disagreeing text from another answer
<a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/posts/142579/revisions"">https://money.stackexchange.com/posts/142579/revisions</a>
(The author of that answer, blankip, also didn't like that any, as indicated by <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3013/moderators-are-the-number-1-reason-i-quit-using-se-tell-me-different"">Moderators are the number 1 reason I quit using SE - tell me different</a> )</p>
<p>Furthermore, the original author has twice re-asserted the importance of these lines in his answer, and the mod has removed such content a total of three times (as of this writing), and even wrote &quot;please discuss it on meta.&quot;  As I reviewed this and support DJClayworth's position, but realize the pressure against going too far in taking on a mod for one's own personal cause, I am hereby trying to support DJClayworth's position when I went ahead and started this conversation on Meta (as the mod directly indicated).</p>
<p>It seems this mod just wants to sanitize the question by censoring any mention of a clear concept.  By watering down DJClayworth's answer, a vital message is removed.  It would be good if the original poster saw the cold, hard truth of this important concept that the mod's actions effectively hide.</p>
<p>Is it a widespread consensus for this site to keep this site so sterile that applicable judgments  are unwelcomed, presumably in an effort to not say something that can be taken as offensive to a guilty party when talking about a topic where a clear offense has allegedly taken place?  With respect to the advantages of a general &quot;be nice&quot; policy, is the most appropriate action really to want to take the course of trying so hard, to be so so so so so safe, that we risk effectively preventing this forum from being able to tackle such a hard truth as what DJClayworth's answer conveyed?</p>
<p>(I see that in addition to blankip creating a topic while I was writing this, as noted above, DJClayworth did start up a meta topic himself while I was writing this.  <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3014/edit-conflict-on-my-answer-locked-with-a-version-i-dont-want"">Edit Conflict on my answer locked with a version I don&#39;t want</a> )</p>

<p>I absolutely would have made the same edit.  Answers should <em>not</em> make personal judgements, and in particular not attack anyone's character.  &quot;<a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/help/conduct"">Be nice</a>&quot; applies not only to the original poster, but to <em>everyone</em> - including the poster's mother. Unless it's actually important to the answer [which it really never should be on Money.SE], leave personal attacks out.</p>
<p>There are ways to word what needed to be said <em>without</em> the salty language, and <em>without</em> impugning anyone's character.  And to be clear, I fully agree with the poster's original statement!  But, if you want to say it, say it <em>nicely</em>.  &quot;I'm sorry that your mom has damaged your credit.&quot; or &quot;Here's how to get out of this hole your mom dug for you.&quot; is sufficient, no?  There's no need to be aggressive.  The answer stands on its own, perfectly fine, without the judgement.  And frankly, the original poster <em>knows</em> they were done wrong by their mother - it's not like you need to point that out to them!</p>
<p>Secondarily, answers really aren't supposed to refer to one another, and so certainly the other answer needed the edit it got.</p>
<p>Finally, <em>never</em> revert a mod edit because you disagree with it. Come to meta and discuss it, or flag the post and explain, or come to chat and talk about it.  Don't just revert it, unless it's clear the mod made a factual mistake <em>that wasn't intended</em>, and even then I would almost always try to reach out and explain first.</p>

<p>I got involved in the question because of a flag. To explain the context of the flag, I need to summarise the different posts and comments:</p>

She just did what she does. She doesn't pay for things unless forced and you enabled it.</em>&quot;</p>
<p>The second answer then got two quite highly upvoted comments:</p>
<p><em>&quot;Your mom didn't screw you over&quot; No... You're right in the fact that &quot;she just did what she does&quot;... which is screwing people over - that's how you get bad credit. This time it was just that the OP ALSO got screwed over.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;She doesn't pay for things unless forced and you enabled it.&quot; What the heck is up with this victim blaming? You make it sound like OP willingly put themselves into the situation without knowing the full details</em></p>
<p>and then the second answer got a &quot;Rude or Abusive&quot; flag, which I was ultimately responding to when I got involved.</p>
<h1 id=""grey-areas"">Grey areas</h1>
<p>In my view, the deleted material falls into multiple grey areas:</p>
<h2 id=""be-nice"">Be nice</h2>
<p>Firstly, Stack Exchange does have a &quot;be nice&quot; policy. Certainly personal attacks on identifiable SE users are almost always inappropriate. Personal attacks on unidentifiable individuals like in this case are less clear-cut. The first answer's statement was a bit over the line in my opinion. Then the second answer directly criticised the OP which was significantly further over the line.</p>
<h2 id=""irrelevant-material"">Irrelevant material</h2>
<p>Secondly, the whole debate about being screwed over or not or being enabled or whatever was pretty much irrelevant to the question. Both answers had much more relevant factual statements about the problems of co-signing and how to get out of them. Readers are perfectly capable of drawing their own conclusions about right and wrong anyway. Yes, sometimes it does make sense to give wider advice than the specific original question, but it's another grey area.</p>
<p>Answers that don't actually address the question are always <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225370/your-answer-is-in-another-castle-when-is-an-answer-not-an-answer"">subject to deletion</a>.</p>
<p>I've always understood that to equally applies to specific bits of irrelevant material in an answer where other parts of it do answer the question, though I don't have a specific reference for that right now. But still, to give an extreme example, I wouldn't expect either &quot;Trump is great&quot; or &quot;down with Trump&quot; to survive long if I included it as a single line in an otherwise perfectly good answer.</p>
<p>In this case of course the statements were at least related to the question but certainly wouldn't have survived as standalone answers in their own right.</p>
<h2 id=""this-isnt-a-discussion-site"">This isn't a discussion site</h2>
<p>The focus of <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/tour"">StackExchange is getting answers</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This site is all about getting answers. It's not a discussion forum.
There's no chit-chat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If someone had actually asked &quot;Did my mom screw me over&quot; that would have been subject to closure as opinion-based.</p>
<p>As with comments, discussions are more likely to get moderated the longer they continue. One or two chatty comments often survive, but if more and more keep appearing then often the whole lot will get removed.</p>
<h2 id=""summary"">Summary</h2>
<p>Overall for me, given the combination of irrelevance, not niceness, and the general back and forth of discussion leading to a &quot;rude and abusive&quot; flag, the logical conclusion was just to remove all that content rather than somehow taking sides by leaving some of it.</p>
<p>We actually get a fair number of flags about answers containing &quot;not nice&quot; content and I generally apply the same test - if it's not directly relevant to the question then removing it as such is the easiest way to deal with it.</p>
<p>Conversely, flags about material which is actually directly relevant to the actual question asked get treated much more skeptically - the answer will typically not get deleted if it's just a bad answer but not rude/abusive etc.</p>
<h1 id=""why-is-this-other-content-still-here"">Why is this other content still here?</h1>
<p>The fact that things aren't consistently removed across the site is not evidence that we think they are ok, just that moderator's time is limited and usually focused on actual controversies - such as the one I was faced with here given the flag and the comments.</p>
<p>I also thought a bit more about the &quot;your girlfriend is a scammer&quot; example and in general I'd expect those kinds of answers are much more likely to be actually relevant to the question.</p>
<h1 id=""edit-wars"">Edit wars</h1>
<p>Firstly, let me be clear that I was acting with my mod hat on all the way through my interaction with this question - I was applying my judgement as a mod when I edited the answer in the first place, and I explicitly stated that the second time I applied the edit by leaving a comment. Ideally a second mod will also weigh into this discussion but this wasn't a case of me forming a &quot;normal user&quot; personal opinion and then using my mod powers to make it stick.</p>
<p>As far as any conflict between &quot;clearly conflicts with author's intent&quot; and &quot;edits that improve a post&quot; go, in the end it's the job of a mod to resolve that. <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3016/366"">Joe's answer</a> explains the general approach to mod edits and edit wars so I won't spend time repeating it. From my side, I could have made it clearer earlier that it was an edit for moderation reasons.</p>
<h1 id=""what-next"">What next?</h1>
<p>I can see a few possible outcomes:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The status quo at the time of writing is that the first answer has been re-edited with a much milder statement, and the second answer is as edited by me.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Go back to the original content as written by the posters of both the first and second answer.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Go back to the original content as written by the poster of the first answer, but not the second answer.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Put both answers back to how they were after I edited them.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall moderation decisions are a judgement call and I'm sure that another mod, or me on a different day, might have made a different one. I don't actually normally spend hours thinking about each decision :-) But now that I have spent a while thinking about it and writing down my instinctive motivations in more detail, I still feel that what I did was a valid moderation choice amongst a range of reasonable options.</p>
<p>As we stand now, I think outcome 1, i.e. the status quo as I write this, is fine and it might be simplest to just leave it at that.</p>
<p>If anyone still wants to push for 2 or 3, i.e. restoring one or both of the stronger statements in the original content, I think another mod should make the call on it. They might want to consider any opinions from mods on other sites, and/or the sample of community opinion demonstrated by the discussion here.</p>

3018,15103,,2,,-2,3015,,,6,,,,,CC BY-SA 4.0,"<p>Whatever the official SE viewpoint here it shows that there is a clear conflict with SE users and the Terms of Service.</p>
<p>If a user hands over their answers to SE and SE is the owner of their answers then there is a subtle contract between the entity (SE) and the user that links the views and the &quot;opinions&quot; of the user to the user and not the entity.</p>
<p>Based on this SE would reserve the right to edit things clearly inappropriate, obscene, or spammish.   But clearly this question is not about these basic &quot;moderated&quot; areas and this question is about changing the opinion of someone in their own name.</p>
<p>The fact that SE employees (whether paid or unpaid) are allowed to edit out of context the &quot;opinions&quot; that the user owns now becomes owned by SE.</p>
<p>What this means... if I as a user want my answers squashed (deleted) from all SE sites I should have the right to do so because the oversite can clearly cause my answers to be completely altered by users and/or SE and these new answers could be defamatory towards my person and cause me as a user unjust future harm.</p>
<p>In a nutshell.    It is illegal to put someone's words on my name.   It doesn't matter if it says it was edited or not.   There is no court in the US that would look at this and think a another outside user (employer/school/community) would research answers and edits and figure out who to attribute the words to.   They would simply use the person's name on the answer.   The moderator here is highlighting an injustice in the SE system where the user who answers a lot of questions could be unjustly harmed by SE and their mods/users.   This is a significant issue but even a bigger issue because the user answering questions that has a chance to be harmed is not getting paid while making money for SE.</p>

<p>I find it to be a compelling observation that it's common to see &quot;Your online girlfriend is a scammer&quot;, et. al., as part of many answers. The fact that the identity of the person being criticized was a certain family member doesn't seem to make it worthy of this outlier treatment.</p>
<p>If the criticism is considered not relevant to the question, then I would prefer to see the community downvote it (or suggest improvement in comments), and not arbitrarily have the substance of the answer changed by moderator fiat.</p>

<p>I upvoted the answer by &quot;GS - Apologise to Monica&quot;, despite that I disagree with the actions taken, and might not even like the answer.  But, the answer is useful (which is supposed to be the criteria for upvoting, according to the tooltips), as the mod explained why sections were taken.</p>
<p>It seems there are some strong feelings from multiple sides.  Personally, I'm not terribly offended by the phrase &quot;Your mom screwed you over.&quot;  I suppose that may be partially because I got familiar with the concept of being &quot;screwed over&quot; as a young child (simply to mean being mistreated), even before I knew of any other slang term of the word &quot;screw&quot;.  But I admit that in today's culture, some people might be more sensitive to that.</p>
<p>Grade 'Eh' Bacon's comment to the original post (of this Meta question) notes people may take this phrasing very differently.  I posted this question (on Meta) because I didn't see the language as being out of line, and I thought the problem was more about saying we shouldn't point out the problem of what the mother did.  But based on feedback I learned from the response here, I see that the specific language used may have been the largest trigger (which may effectively be the clear answer to my core question).</p>
<p>I think the best suggestion I've seen is from Don Branson's comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Your mom has harmed you financially and you'll want to be careful in the future.&quot; That doesn't carry the same punch (and the original is what I'd really want to say), but it at least warns the OP they'll need to be wary from now on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While Don's proposed phrasing is less succinct and perhaps less powerful, it does also sidestep the offensiveness that apparently triggered a flag and which the mod (&quot;GS - Apologise to Monica&quot;) acted on (probably in agreement).  Joe's answer here also suggests this.</p>
<p>I disagree with the mod's assertion that this text is not relevant.  While the OP may be realizing that mom's behavior is causing some inconvenience, it might be helpful to point out that this behavior was really totally bad to its core.  Therefore, the removed text might not be phrased as nice-sounding as some may prefer, but the presence of the text was quite relevant (and, therefore, I disagree with it being removed completely on the basis of irrelevance).</p>
<p>I suspect going with Don Branson's sample text wouldn't fully satisfy  DJClayworth's position of wanting original wording.  However, I believe Stack Exchange is not fully about free speech when the speech seems to violate the &quot;Be Nice&quot; policy.  Some aspects of Stack Exchange's culture is entrenched, which is that there are some expectations of speech, and some controls including Mods having power and expectations that people don't resist or fight too hard against the mods (commenting on Meta is okay, but constantly reverting is getting a bit too aggressive).</p>
<p>I know my score on this Stack Exchange site may be lower, but I do have some Stack Exchange experience (namely over 10,000 on Super User).  I've encounted feelings of being dissatisfied with some of Stack Exchange's behaviors/culture before, including concerns about words being inserted by someone else's name.  I suspect that DJClayworth is going to end up being dissatisfied about not being fully free to express as desired.  Similarly, I suspect blankip may be dissatisfied with how heavy-handed mod behavior can be.  However, as much as I agree or disagree with some of these aspects, I've come to expect such behavior can happen on the Stack Exchange sites, and I think eventually the consensus will lie on supporting having text which is not deemed too offensive to multiple people.</p>
<p>So if DJClayworth showed accepting cooperation by updating the text to Don Branson's sample, then the moderator (&quot;GS - Apologise to Monica&quot;) would be not completely satisfied because there would still be some text about a topic that the moderator deems to be irrelevant.  But it wouldn't be using language that i too objectionable.  DJClayworth would be dissatisfied for not being able to have the same punch (to use Don Branson's phrasing), but could still communicate an important concept to whomever read his answer.  Neither side getting fully what is hoped for, but a compromise that allows key information to be spread without stomping too hard on the oppositions most important concerns.</p>
<p>Except blankip and DJClayworth might still be unhappy about being moderated this way and not having more freedom, but I think that's rather entrenched in Stack Exchange culture so I predict there isn't going to be much wiggle room given on that front.</p>
<p>I realize I haven't commented as much about main concerns blankip brought up about how downvotes ended up getting applied.  I commented less on that so far namely since I feel less significant strong insight or recommendations about that.  I suspect some of the downvoting might be sensible for some of the same reason that DJClayworth was being upvoted, since the first sentence of blankip's comment was basically saying the opposite of a key statement from DJClayworth's popular answer.  Some people probably ignore the guidelines on how upvoting/downvoting should occur, and may upvote/downvote based on disagreeing with text (not necessarily considering whether it might be useful, like I did with the answer by &quot;GS - Apologise to Monica&quot;).</p>

<p>I personally might have ignored this as informal. As a member. As a mod, had I seen this first, I'd have seen it as potentially offensive and easily edited out. I think the sentiment offered could easily have been communicated with language a bit kinder.</p>
<p>To answer the OP now - I think it best that judgements be avoided. The original question really didn't contain enough detail to pass such a judgement.

<p>Before the edit, your point #1 is describing a person that you know nothing about. You have taken it a step further than DJClayworth to say that, not only did the mother do something wrong here, that she always does this as a pattern, which you don't know. You then go on to blame the OP, which I think many see as over the top and is also speculative.</p>
<p>This original point #1 was taken out by the mod, so the downvotes you received after that point are not because of this. But apparently there were downvotes and a flag based on this that prompted the mod’s action.</p>
<p>Left after the mod edit, your point #2 (originally #3) is probably not a smart idea. You acknowledge this yourself when you say, “You should never co-sign, ever.”  Even with your alternative scheme, you still have most of the same problems as anyone does with co-signing: As soon as payments are missed, there are dings on your credit report, and you either have to start making payments or try to get rid of a car that is likely upside-down in value. It is best just to stick with “never co-sign.”</p>

On Stack Exchange, there have been issues raised with the appropriateness of some of the topics, which is a particular problem when they <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/318792/what-kinds-of-question-titles-put-a-sites-hnq-presence-at-risk"">appear out-of-context on the Hot Network Questions list</a>.  I can understand that some people would be uncomfortable when they arrive at our site looking for information on finances, and instead are shown a bunch of questions about sugar daddies.</p>
<p>For me, I don't mind the usual sugar daddy questions too much.  They are coming from people who are in bad situations, and either need to be headed away from a bad path, or they need to be guided to their next steps after being scammed.  I'm happy that we can help them.</p>
<p>However, this question did not come from someone looking for help.  It instead asked, &quot;If yes [it exists], what should someone seeking a sugar daddy relationship look for, and what steps can they take to identity and avoid scams?&quot;  I think that outlining the &quot;proper&quot; way to enter a sugar daddy relationship is outside the line of decency and is off-topic for our site.</p>

<p>It's common to use Google translate to communicate. I frequently get emails intended for a business in Europe, and to be kind, I reply in French or Spanish to let the writer know they have the wrong guy. To use these 2 languages isn't an outlier. This is what the translator gave me -</p>

<p>The same result occurs when using French as the target language. Had DJ dropped an F bomb in his answer, one would likely not have had an issue with a mod editing that out. What I'd propose here is that to many readers, the chosen phase was equivalent to just that. To some, &quot;screwed over&quot; has a different level of offense than for others.</p>

<p>The answer, after the fact, isn't helpful to the OP. And while I acknowledge that &quot;because others might look at this for help&quot; is actually useful, it would have been better to first answer the question as asked.</p>
<p>To be fair - there are many times we have this issue, new members asking for help after the fact, and we, I included, often give a warning to the future visitor but do little to help the OP. It's almost like you are saying &quot;it's too late to help you, but let's try to help others from making this same mistake.&quot; Right?</p>
<p>All of this is separate from the Mod edit. Once GS edited the first answer, your line, using the same phrase, needed editing as well.</p>
<p>I'm sorry you feel this way. In general, I think we rarely make this type of edit in questions or answers. I know I've changed &quot;your tax guy is a moron&quot; to &quot;you tax guy seems to have made an error&quot; or similar, but not more than every few months, if that much.</p>
<p>We are at a point where I think we agree that &quot;be nice&quot; is something we'd like to stick to, but perhaps can't agree on where that line is. I'm in favor of a very low tolerance of ad hominem attacks and offensive language. I don't know how to articulate the line, but maybe to where we are as kind as we'd expect to hear one's 6 year old child speak. Is it acceptable if she came home and said &quot;I got a C on my test, my teacher screwed me!&quot; This is not &quot;policy&quot;, it's an attempt to move forward in a way that's part of a community discussion on where the line is. I almost was going to suggest &quot;The language you'd be comfortable using in your house of worship&quot;, which of course leaves out our valued atheist members, or &quot;how you'd talk in front of your mother-in-law&quot; which has its own problems.</p>
<p>And, no matter how we arrive at a reasonable consensus, we'll have new members who don't read the FAQ, Take the Tour, etc, as well as seasoned members who would interpret any guidance differently. We mods are aware of the gray area, and even with issues of what's on topic, often chat, and are sensitive to erring on the side of caution. When I see a meta &quot;why was my question closed&quot; I'm happy to look and see it was 5 non-mods who voted it closed. It means the system is working. There are other times we'll intervene quickly, depending on the issue.</p>
<p>It may be time to have a meta question on how to narrow the gray area of the line between kind and unkind. These are just my own thoughts toward that goal.</p>

<p>which ultimately became a case of &quot;You should speak to the lender.&quot; You answered it basically that way. We still disagree about the value of HNQ, and I still maintain that some questions are best not promoted.</p>

<p>First, I agree that the question should not be closed or protected.  The question is undoubtedly on-topic.  And anything that could be construed as unkind was edited out of the question (not by a mod) less than 5 minutes from posting.  So there really isn't a problem there, either.</p>
<p>I disagree with your assertion that this is not a good question.  You insinuate that the question was too easy, that it only took you a moment to find the answer, but in fact, it is not obvious to everyone, and this is evidenced by the fact that an incorrect answer was posted before mine.  You also call the question &quot;unanswerable,&quot; which is also not true.  Informing the OP that private loans do not have standard terms is indeed exactly the answer she needed.  Remember that people post questions that they don't know the answer to.  When a question is asked with a mistaken premise, that does not make it a bad question, and it does not make it unanswerable.  The correct answer is to correct the premise and teach the OP something new.  The OP apparently found my answer helpful, because she accepted it.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about the HNQ.  The HNQ is a way for our site to be promoted across the Stack Exchange network.  Our site is not the most popular site on Stack Exchange, and by having links to questions on the HNQ, it brings new attention and participation to our site.  Isn't that a good thing?  It doesn't really even matter what the question is that is being linked.  A user on Stack Overflow will read the title and find it interesting, and click on it, bringing them to our site.  Then they read the question and perhaps learn something new, and perhaps see what else is on our site.</p>
<p>That is exactly the kind of free publicity we need.  We should celebrate every time one of our questions trends, and it doesn't really matter what the question is.  It costs us nothing.</p>
<p>When you manually remove a question from the HNQ, it does absolutely nothing positive for our site.  You say you don't want to promote that question, but it's not like that means that another one of our questions that you do like will automatically appear.  Trending happens organically and is out of our control.  If you remove us from the HNQ, a question from a different site will appear in its place.</p>
<p>I can imagine a scenario where a particular question might need to be removed from the HNQ, but it would be very rare.  We've <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2728/10997"">talked about potentially removing &quot;sugar daddy&quot; questions from the HNQ</a> as those could be seen as inappropriate when seen out of context on other sites.  Maybe there would be some question in the future that would be an embarrassment to our site for some reason, and for whatever reason it could not be closed.  But just you not liking a question is not enough, in my opinion, to sabotage this avenue of promotion of our site as a whole.</p>
<p>In my opinion, mods should not be attempting to use their power to remove questions from the HNQ to try to manipulate what gets promoted on the site.  It is not possible; a mod cannot choose what will be popular, and removing something from the HNQ that is not causing a legitimate problem hurts the site.</p>

I for one would have been happy to see this qone closed as opinion-based, but I knew that it was possible to answer with just facts.</p>
<p>If mods were to attempt to enforce 100% sanitizing of answers to remove all opinion or emotion, it would not be taken well by our membership.</p>
<p>The answer to your headline question is &quot;No. But. Not everything is black and white. The current question you take issue with is gray, and should not be considered typical of good Money.SE questions.&quot;</p>

Sometimes, an opinion is required to explain why the answerer gave the answer that he or she did. Sometimes, the answerer feels that there is something extra that would be helpful for the asker or future readers to be told, even if it is something that the asker doesn’t necessarily want to hear.</p>
<p>If you don’t like or don’t agree with the opinion stated in the answer, you can downvote the answer, and if you feel the opinion makes unfounded assumptions or is rude or abusive, it can be edited out or flagged for moderator review. But we need our expert answerers to feel free to post the best, most complete answer they can, and that usually includes opinion.</p>
<p>Having opinion in posted answers is much better than answer/opinions posted as comments, <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2299/10997"">for a number of reasons</a>. If we attempt to remove all opinions from answers, then we are unintentionally encouraging them to be posted as comments, which is exactly the wrong thing to do.</p>
<p>As for <em>questions</em>, a question being “primarily opinion-based” is one of the official reasons for closure on Stack Exchange. The idea is that we don’t want questions and answers that are purely subjective and completely a matter of personal opinion. However, in practice, this works out differently on each Stack Exchange site. Our topic here, personal finance, requires a great deal of personal opinion. <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2767/10997"">This has been discussed on meta before.</a> Basically, we have decided that questions asking us to try to predict the future (including specific buy/sell recommendations) are too opinion-based to be allowed. But most of our questions and answers here do need some personal opinion; that is just the nature of the topic we are dealing with.</p>

<p>As we say goodbye to the old year and welcome the new one, we have <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=%22year+in+moderation%22+is%3Aquestion"">a tradition of sharing moderation stats for the preceding calendar year</a>.</p>
<p>As most of you here are aware, sites on the Stack Exchange network are moderated somewhat differently to other sites on the web:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We designed the Stack Exchange network engine to be mostly self-regulating, in that we amortize the overall moderation cost of the system across thousands of teeny-tiny slices of effort contributed by regular, everyday users.<br />
-- <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/"">A Theory of Moderation</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That doesn't eliminate the need for having <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/11/21/our-theory-of-moderation-re-visited/"">moderators</a> altogether, but it does mean that the bulk of moderation work is carried out by regular folks. Every bit of time and effort y'all contribute to the site gives you access to more privileges you can use to help in this effort, all of which produce a cumulative effect that makes a big difference.</p>
<p>So as we say goodbye to 2021, let us look back at what we accomplished as a community... by looking at some <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KZntT.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>exciting</em> stats</a>.

<p>² The system will suspend users under three circumstances: when a user is recreated after being previously suspended, when a user is recreated after being destroyed for spam or abuse, and when a network-wide suspension is in effect on an account.</p>
<p>³ A &quot;destroyed&quot; user is deleted along with all that they had posted: questions, answers, comments. <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/88994/what-is-the-difference-between-a-deleted-user-and-a-destroyed-user"">Generally used as an expedient way of getting rid of spam.</a></p>
<p>⁴ This counts every review that was submitted (not skipped) - so the 2 suggested edits reviews needed to approve an edit would count as 2, the goal being to indicate the frequency of moderation actions. This also applies to flags, etc.</p>
<p>⁵ Includes close flags (but <em>not</em> close or reopen votes).</p>
<p>⁶ This ignores numerous deletions that happen automatically in response to some other action.</p>
<p>⁷ This includes comments deleted by their own authors (which also account for some number of handled comment flags).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you have to ask, it's a scam.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This gets a million upvotes, because it's a pithy, short statement that is easy to agree with, especially when the question goes HNQ.  It's one I mostly agree with, and don't want to call anyone out for doing this - I've probably made the comment, but I think we shouldn't.</p>
<p>It's sort of insulting/condescending, and likely to lead the asker to have a worse experience as it questions why they bothered to ask in the first place.  Further, it doesn't really help - some are and some aren't; we've certainly had plenty of &quot;is this a scam&quot; questions that <em>weren't</em> scams.   It's also, basically, an answer in comments - even though as an answer it would be a bad one.  Don't forget, also, these are often new users.</p>
<p>There's better ways to get at this feeling - that the asker is right to have their alarm bells go off - that both lead to a positive, not negative, experience, and use the comment box and answer box appropriately.</p>
<p>Can we as a group agree not to make this comment (at least those of us who are regular users), even if it's often true - and flag it as unnecessary for removal when we see it?</p>

<p>The existence of that comment indicates a problem. The cause of said problem is that extremely obvious &quot;is this a scam&quot; questions are being asked, and re-asked, and re-re-asked. This accomplishes nothing except creating a swathe of duplicate questions with a swathe of duplicate answers, and it irritates users because these very obvious dupes keep getting massively upvoted for no good reason. It also allows askers and answerers to grind reputation.</p>
<p>Your &quot;solution&quot; to this problem is to ban the comment, which like most bans is fixing the symptom, not the cause. Instead there should be a canonical &quot;is this a scam&quot; question, with examples of common scams in its canonical answer. Or if you really want to slice and dice, have separate canonical questions and answers for each common scam.</p>
<p>Then make people aware (perhaps via Help Centre) of what these canonical question(s) are, and the next time a duplicate comes up, <strong>flag to close it as a duplicate of the relevant canonical</strong>. That prevents all of the problems listed above and will also prevent the posting of this comment, because if people see the question is closed when they land on it they won't bother to post said comment.</p>

3074,2998,,2,,7,3072,,,0,,,,,CC BY-SA 4.0,"<p>First of all, your question includes a link to advertise a service. You may not have intended it in that way, but folks on this forum don't appreciate spam. Marking a question as spam automatically downvotes it.</p>
<p>But even without asking about a specific service, your question calls for opinions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What are his best options considering he lives in a single household in California, rent, auto loan, and credits used up?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who decides what's best? How do <strong>you</strong> measure what's best for you? We don't know. Is your &quot;best&quot; the same as my &quot;best&quot;? We don't know. Is debt consolidation even a good idea? We don't know.</p>
<p>You described a situation which has some unnecessary details (like a sob story about military service and something that wasn't clear to me about Afghanistan), but essentially your question boils down to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm in a pile of debt, who can help me get out of it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this is either a product recommendation (that mhoran_psprep already explained we don't want to give), or a solicitation for opinions (which is a standard closing reason on Stack Exchange, on any forum).</p>
<p>Instead, you can frame your question differently.</p>
<p>For example, you can ask:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm in a pile of debt, what are the different options available?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or you can ask:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How to evaluate a debt consolidation service?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How to decide whether bankruptcy is appropriate?</p>

3075,187,,2,,2,3072,,,0,,,,,CC BY-SA 4.0,"<p>The one thing I’d add to the answers is that each stack has its own personality its own description of what fits.</p>
<p>To be sure, there are common rules. The entire site is not a discussion board, it’s meant for Q&amp;A, not a running dialog. This wasn’t the issue with the linked question. There’s also a “be nice” policy. The mods are committed to addressing insults, ad hominem attacks, quickly.</p>
<p>Other than that, the rules you are used to on law.se don’t necessarily apply here. Citing an 11+ year old post as some kind of precedent may get an old post that slipped through the cracks closed or deleted, but no one that I know is actively checking older questions to see if they warrant some action.</p>
<p>I hope you visit again, and gain some knowledge from this site. For what it’s worth, I’ve had similar unpleasant experiences on other stacks, bad enough that I deleted my membership to 2 other particular ones.

3083,26769,26769,1,,0,,7,0,0,,,2022: a year in moderation,<discussion><moderation><statistics>,CC BY-SA 4.0,"
<p>As we say goodbye to the old year and welcome the new one, we have <a href=""https://money.meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=%22year+in+moderation%22+is%3Aquestion"">a tradition of sharing moderation stats for the preceding calendar year</a>.</p>
<p>As most of you here are aware, sites on the Stack Exchange network are moderated somewhat differently to other sites on the web:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We designed the Stack Exchange network engine to be mostly self-regulating, in that we amortize the overall moderation cost of the system across thousands of teeny-tiny slices of effort contributed by regular, everyday users.<br />
-- <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/"">A Theory of Moderation</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That doesn't eliminate the need for having <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/11/21/our-theory-of-moderation-re-visited/"">moderators</a> altogether, but it does mean that the bulk of moderation work is carried out by regular folks. Every bit of time and effort y'all contribute to the site gives you access to more privileges you can use to help in this effort, all of which produce a cumulative effect that makes a big difference.</p>
<p>So as we say goodbye to 2022 (and where did January go, right?) and dive head first into 2023, let us look back at what we accomplished as a community... by looking at some <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/V0TPg.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>exciting</em> stats</a>.

<p>³ A &quot;destroyed&quot; user is deleted along with all that they had posted: questions, answers, comments. <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/88994/what-is-the-difference-between-a-deleted-user-and-a-destroyed-user"">Generally used as an expedient way of getting rid of spam.</a></p>
<p>⁴ This counts every review that was submitted (not skipped) - so the 2 suggested edits reviews needed to approve an edit would count as 2, the goal being to indicate the frequency of moderation actions. This also applies to flags, etc.</p>
<p>⁵ Includes close flags (but <em>not</em> close or reopen votes). Community can handle these flags by at least one person voting to close a question that has a close flag.</p>
<p>⁶ This ignores numerous deletions that happen automatically in response to some other action.</p>
<p>⁷ This includes comments deleted by their own authors (which also account for some number of handled comment flags).</p>

3084,12439,,1,,0,,44,2,1,,,Should we be referring more questions to https://quant.stackexchange.com,<discussion><quant>,CC BY-SA 4.0,"<p>I have no idea where people draw the line, but many of the recent questions about &quot;how do I calculate this investment number&quot; strike me as being a better fit there than here, since they're based on the assumption that the formula has some predictive value and to me that means quant.</p>
<p>Basic stuff like apr and history is within our remit. I'm not convinced anything much deeper is.</p>
<p>But I'm not convinced it isn't either.</p>
<p>It's all fractals and fuzz at the dividing line, but we should be able to at least state a principle, and maybe publish it so folks know which stack to start in before being redirected.</p>

3085,366,,2,,1,3084,,,3,,,,,CC BY-SA 4.0,"<p>This is only a partial answer, addressing the general question of whether questions should be redirected at all, particularly if they've already been posted on one site.</p>
<p>There's a <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/10250/132930"">good network-wide answer</a> about this, and I'm reproducing the key flowchart here:</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rXVl2.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rXVl2.png"" alt=""When should I vote to migrate a question?"" /></a></p>
<p>Many questions that might seem too esoteric for this site still won't be a good fit for quant, regardless of that. Judging from the comments, <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/154922/what-are-alternatives-to-black-scholes-model-that-doesnt-assume-random-walk-beh"">this question</a> is a good example of that.</p>
<p>Overall, I would recommend focusing on what's good for this site and not so much on what might or might not fit elsewhere. There'll be a chasm regardless of any boundary we draw here.</p>

<p>Please do not copy them from other web pages, even if they are short. As well as being against the rules, these generic summaries are often not helpful for explaining to people how the tag is used on this site.</p>
<p>When reviewing these edits, it is important to check for plagiarism; at least do a quick web search for the new text.</p>
<p>If you come across existing tag wiki material that has been plagiarised then please edit it out and explain why in the edit summary.</p>
<p>There's a general StackExchange guide on writing good tag wikis <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/214338/132930"">here</a>.</p>

<p>In the case where a wiki excerpt exists on another SE but not here, that'd be convenient to have a way to copy the wiki excerpt (if also relevant here) while keeping the attributions.</p>

3091,366,366,2,,1,3090,,,0,,,,,CC BY-SA 4.0,"<p>I agree about merging and propose <code>rsu</code> as the merged tag because it's how the concept is often referred to.</p>
<p>EDIT:
Now done. I did pause briefly as there were 59 <code>restricted-stock</code> questions and only 7 <code>rsu</code> ones, but almost all of the 59 explicitly used the term &quot;RSU&quot;, so I think my argument that it's the more common name still holds.</p>

In general, if we have duplicate questions, we want the best question-and-answer(s) be the one to remain open.  If it is a toss up, we would probably give the edge to the older question.</p>
<p>In this case, it's a tough call.  The older question essentially says, &quot;Is it right that they do this?&quot; and the answers say, &quot;Yes, it is, and here is how you handle it on your Schedule D.&quot;  The new question essentially says, &quot;Here is what they do.  What is the law/regulation that requires that they do this?&quot;  The new answer explains the reason behind it and references the tax code.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the new question and answer are more informative, so it makes sense that it would be the one to remain open.</p>

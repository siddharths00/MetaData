<p>I primarily work in Clojure/ClojureScript, but I have built small to medium-sized products (sub-million LOC) using Python, C#, C/C++, Java, Pascal and JavaScript.</p>

<ul>
<li>2007-2011 Rhythm Music Store: online music store / record label that that sold 80k MP3s online.</li>
<li>MyNames: an API to register .CO.ZA domains and provision nameservers. Stack: Python, AngularJS.</li>
<li>Krit.com: a mobile customer feedback tool that used geolocation and SMS to bridge the gap between customers and retail managers</li>
<li>2007-2016: iFix (now weFix) Repair Management System tracks 500k repairs and millions in revenues at 36+ branches. Acquired by weFix.</li>
<li>...several others.</li>

<p>Originally, I was going to go with an Atari... but it was a big expense for my family... and after months of me nagging, my dad agreed to buy an Apple ][.  The few months in childhood seem to last forever.  A few months nowadays seem to pass like days.  Those days, a computer had 16kb or 48kb of RAM.  Today, the computer has 16GB.  So it is in fact a million times.</p>
<p>A floppy disk as I remember had 143kb, and it was already a luxury. Many people who couldn't afford a floppy disk drive had to use a tape recorder and cassette tapes that usually is used for music to record their programs. And then the floppy disk went to 1.4MB... the hard drive went from 20MB in about 1986 to 200MB in 1991, and then 1GB, 2GB, 16GB, 200GB, 500GB, 1TB, 4TB, 18TB.</p>
<p>I do feel it this way: if the hard drive is 2GB max, you can wait a couple of months or even half a year and nothing changes. The price stays the same and the capacity do not change at all. But if you look at 143kb vs 18TB, that's mind blowing.</p>
<p>Processors went from 1MHz (of Apple]['s 6502) to today's 5GHz, so it is 5000 times. If we consider it 9 cores and hyperthreading, then it is 90,000 times.</p>
<p>If we compare 20MB to 18TB, it is 900,000 times, so it looks like RAM and hard drive went up about one million times but a processor went up less.</p>

<h1>Python 3 vs Raku</h1>
<h2>Python 3: Unordered common lines between two files:</h2>
<pre><code>#!/bin/env python

import argparse

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Determine the lines in common between two files')

parser.add_argument('fileA', help='file name')
parser.add_argument('fileB', help='file name')

args = parser.parse_args()

with open(args.fileA) as x: linesA = x.readlines()
with open(args.fileB) as x: linesB = x.readlines()

intersection = set(linesA).intersection(set(linesB))

print(&quot;&quot;.join(sorted(intersection)))
</code></pre>
<p>Usage message resulting from <code>python intersection_of_lines.py --help</code>:</p>
<pre><code>usage: intersection_of_lines.py [-h] fileA fileB

Determine the lines in common between two files

positional arguments:
  fileA       file name
  fileB       file name

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
</code></pre>
<h2>Raku: Unordered common lines between two files:</h2>
<pre><code>#!/bin/env raku

sub MAIN #= Determine the lines in common between two files
(   $fileA, #= file name
    $fileB, #= file name
)
{
    my @linesA = $fileA.IO.lines;
    my @linesB = $fileB.IO.lines;

    my $intersection = @linesA ∩ @linesB;

    put $intersection.keys.sort.join(&quot;\n&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Yes that is <code>∩</code>, a real Unicode intersection symbol. The ASCII version <code>(&amp;)</code> also works.</p>
<p>You also get a nice usage message resulting from <code>raku intersection_of_lines.raku --help</code>:</p>
<pre><code>Usage:
  ./intersection_of_lines.raku &lt;fileA&gt; &lt;fileB&gt; -- Determine the lines in common between two files

    &lt;fileA&gt;    file name
    &lt;fileB&gt;    file name
</code></pre>

<h1>Raku tidbits</h1>
<p>Raku is a very clean, concise, understandable language. Its design pulls from the strengths of other languages.</p>

3362,42163,1282,1,0,2,Mark E. Haase,"McLean, VA, United States",,https://markhaa.se,"<p>Hi! I have been working full-time as a software engineer since I graduated from college in 2005. I began coding when I was 13, and I have loved it ever since. My main interest area is information security – or <em>cyber</em> if you prefer – and in addition to writing security software for a long time, I have also done some penetration testing work. In the last three years, I have been working as a contractor on a DARPA R&amp;D contract involving web crawling, dark web, and machine learning.</p>
<p>My main strength is developing web applications in high-level languages – Python is my favorite – but I consider myself more of a general hacker who is comfortable working with a wide range of technologies and learning whatever I need to accomplish the task at hand. (I suppose that <em>full-stack</em> is the trendy term.) In my study of infosec, I have spent a lot of time learning to read assembly and reverse engineer applications to develop exploits. (I have the OSCP, CISSP, and CEH certifications.)</p>
<p>I have released a couple of work projects as open source. I created an easy-to-use web crawler called <a href=""https://gitlab.com/hyperion-gray/starbelly"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Starbelly</a>, as well as a database migrations system called <a href=""https://github.com/TeamHG-Memex/agnostic"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Agnostic</a>. And if you want to get really nerdy with me, I wrote a tiny utility called <a href=""https://github.com/TeamHG-Memex/sshadduser"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>sshadduser</code></a> that simplifies the error-prone process of giving somebody SSH access to a server. I also like writing and teaching. In addition to developing infosec courses for government clients, I also participate here on Stack Overflow and infrequently publish on <a href=""https://markhaa.se"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">my tech blog</a>.</p>
<p>I have been working full-time remote for several years now out of my home office in the Washington DC area. I am seeking contract work (1099) for 2018.</p>

<p>M$ had this great idea to just integrate all of its software so that they would all work together seamlessly. This would be great for users of this software since this would make doing things like importing a webpage in a Ward processing (because in magicland we have wards instead of words) document, seemlessly and natively.</p>

<p>But this would evidently make the software too good. And we cant have people getting software that is too good. Because then if another company came along with their own version of good software people will be too dumb to install and use that if they have the already integrated versions that were included. So the Neanderthal Union decreed that M$ was using its magical abilities to make things too difficult for smaller developers to create super complex applications that they must give away for free. And said you will no longer make things work together seemlessly.</p>

<p>And instead of extending their middle wand to the NeU and saying fine we shall no longer make software that can be used in the NeU... M$ bowed before the luddites and said ok. So now you can not rename a file from inside of your office productivity suite in Magicland.</p>

<p>I began my professional career working for consulting firms, then started my own software company and created 17 programs providing speech therapy to stroke survivors .  I marketed and sold it worldwide.  A few years ago, I fully automated my company so it wouldn’t need my involvement, freeing me for new challenges.  I’ve spent my career helping technical and non-technical stakeholders understand each other’s needs.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I returned to consulting, sharpening my skills in areas that I most enjoyed as a business owner. As I took classes and read a wide range of books, what particularly resonated was the importance of listening.  For example, each sale happens in the prospect’s mind. They know what they want. They’ll tell us if we ask and listen with genuine curiosity.   I first learned this selling our software. After I explained what a patient needed, caregivers often asked “how did you know exactly what we need?”.  I just smiled, never revealing my secret: I asked curious questions. You <em>told</em> me.

<p>Since Stack Exchange has effectively turned my profile page into a political platform without my foreknowledge or consent, I feel obligated to share my own views:</p>

<p>An oligarchy of five justices setting policy for the entire USA is not the government the Constitution guarantees, and it's not the one we want.  Not everything President Gerald Ford said was very smart or worth repeating, but this is</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A government big enough to give you everything you want is a government big enough to take from you everything you have.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The USA was designed as a Constitutional Republic, with checks-and-balances between the branches of the federal government, and also division of power between federal state and local governments.  (And these are explicitly required by the plain language of the Constitution)  All government officials need to stay within the authority granted to them by the Constitution, especially when that means they can't do whatever they want.</p>

<p>Scientists add layers to untangle and reverse engineer such miracles, which spawned machine learning. Neurons in brains discovered long before humans did, that the partial derivative of an N dimensional array with respect to a direction yields the slope of a tangent line to a point on a curve. If the 2d surface is wrongness, the slope points where to go to be less wrong. An array of slopes nudge the model until convergence.  Pipe unseen observations to the fitted model then do RMSE, rank order using tournament and genetic algorithm. I suspect there are tiers of fractals of this happening in 5, 6, nay 7 dimensions of freedom in brains</p>
<p>That Calculus 2 is happening in the molecules of cells and causes life to get noticeably better after every generation. There's a vector dot product, matrix multiplication, root mean squared error, Bayes rule for stacking and consolidating probabilities, voting, genetic algorithm.  Neurotransmitters mark results of cellular tournament brackets (Babies need 9 months, not a week at the speed of fungi) defense of checkpoints from loss and crossover policy to splice what worked best from left and right, now you have a new copy that could potentially have all the best adaptation discoveries from two genetic lines</p>
<p>Human DNA has a hyperlinked partition table.  When punctuated equilibrium is tripped to full throttle, whole organs and limbs get replaced with what is maximally keyed to survival.  The brain monitors its own start/stop indices keyed to correlations that are marked by brain as MVP for leaving copies, and changes the segments of the DNA via sperm-datafile, egg-Emulator, and egg-datafile following the partition tables of function and probability</p>
<p>By mirroring the behaviors above in software simulations and applying it to dominate every conceivable game in narrow domains and later larger domains without human help, at some point in the next thousand years it will turn its evolution pipeline inward, as life did, then hybrid evolve to become the first mover of the dense lump at the beginning of everything, to once again choose the straightest N paths to create a universe</p>
<p>The perfect version of an artificial intelligence with access to unlimited resources, one that I see in my dreams, that could collapse the universe to achieve ends, already exists and I see its fourth of july batting around individual atoms, everywhere.  The meaning of life is to recreate the universe. Biological ability replicating itself into metal is a rung on that ladder to that ends.</p>

10019,368463,194,3,5,9,Chad,"Springfield, IL, USA",,,"<p>Once Upon a time a magical company called MagicDollars (for the sake of brevity for the rest of the answer we will refer to this company by its stock ticker M$)  and this company made the most widely used, operating system, internet browser, office productivity suite, and various other products. </p>

<p>M$ had this great idea to just integrate all of its software so that they would all work together seamlessly. This would be great for users of this software since this would make doing things like importing a webpage in a Ward processing (because in magicland we have wards instead of words) document, seemlessly and natively.</p>

<p>But this would evidently make the software too good. And we cant have people getting software that is too good. Because then if another company came along with their own version of good software people will be too dumb to install and use that if they have the already integrated versions that were included. So the Neanderthal Union decreed that M$ was using its magical abilities to make things too difficult for smaller developers to create super complex applications that they must give away for free. And said you will no longer make things work together seemlessly.</p>

<p>And instead of extending their middle wand to the NeU and saying fine we shall no longer make software that can be used in the NeU... M$ bowed before the luddites and said ok. So now you can not rename a file from inside of your office productivity suite in Magicland.</p>

I feel a strong sense of fragility every time I break out the credit card and buy a domain name.  And watching elected moderators fall by the wayside over arguments over put-your-pronouns-in-your-profile makes me wonder if it's an accident that stackoverflow overtook <code>expertsexchange.com</code> (ha ha, expert sex change, wait, was that a joke in the first place?).  How can these petty human issues destroy our collective knowledge about programming?  What's with the status war over gender pronouns?  Not like I knew who Monica was before, but how the hell did Shog9 get fired?  How did this happen?  And it's kind of like seeing how weak the entirety of the world is by virtue of electing Trump, we are all way...way...too...hackable.)</p>

I started my site intending to get to the bottom of &quot;why we all can't just get along&quot; as a bit of an SEO/keyword hack.  It worked...try googling &quot;hostile fork&quot;.)</em></p>
<p>Until I figure out how to make everyone bring the best ideas to the table, I'm just blogging about software development.  Long term I hope that people searching for &quot;hostile fork x&quot; will find my site and consider engagement instead of forking.  Yet somehow it's easier to answer StackOverflow questions than make people get along.  Who knew?</p>

Since February 2014, <strong>Ukraine has been suffering from Russia's armed invasion</strong> and attempted occupation.<br />
14,000 civillians <a href=""https://tinyurl.com/4r766hmm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">killed</a> Feb/2014-Feb/2022.<br />

<strong>1,900,000 forcibly deported</strong> to russia, incl <a href=""https://tinyurl.com/yc6v7bca"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">300,000 children</a>.<br />
6,900,000 refugees recorded across Europe.<br />
8,000,000 more internally displaced.</p>
<p>Invading Ukraine, however, is not the final goal for the Russian war in Europe. Their officials said numerous times: they are fighting against NATO. Ukraine is just &quot;lucky&quot; to be on their way.</p>
<h2>On their way to you.</h2>
<p>Read again: The final goal is you. Your house, your land, your history, your language, your freedom, your values. <strong>Your life.</strong><br />
If we fail to stop russians on Ukrainian soil, someone else (read: you) would have to stop them in Poland, Finland, Baltic states, and finally, on your backyard.</p>
<p>While there is no doubt that NATO can defend your land, think if you want to have a burning Russian tank in front of your home:</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XQwCr.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XQwCr.jpg"" alt=""Bucha full of destroyed ru tanks"" /></a></p>

<p>Or if you want to become a &quot;collateral victim&quot; when a KGB terrorist assassinates someone using <strong>weapons of mass destruction</strong> in the center of your city.</p>
<p>Don't worry, the UN will express its &quot;deep concern&quot; about the loss of you.<br />
And even once-respected Stack Exchange network would <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/376743/187133"">find nothing better than say</a>, <em>&quot;well, okay, your death is a pity, but it's not a reason to ban the service on russias&quot;</em>.</p>
<h2>Your future depends on your actions <strong>NOW</strong>.</h2>
<p>Would you wait for russians come? Or would you act now?</p>
<ul>
<li>by calling your Senator to ensure more weapons to Ukraine?</li>
<li>by donating to Ukrainian volunteers?</li>
<li>by eliminating <a href=""https://tinyurl.com/2je9c4yc"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">putinverstehers</a> in your politicum?</li>
<li>or, well, by stopping consuming russian propaganda (incl. reading some users here at SE network)?</li>
</ul>
<p>The world has to stay together to stop Russian metastasis in Europe as well as the Russian-equipped, Russian-trained, Russian-financed, and Russian-inspired terrorism all over the world.</p>
<p>Please help Ukraine defend you.<br />
Please <strong>Support Ukraine.</strong></p>

<p>I'm a hobbyist programmer who loves thinking about how systems talk to each other. I've dabbled with technologies like JavaScript/Node.js, C, Python, Rails, and SQL and have developed a real love for UNIX environments. In the near future, I want to learn more about networking. I'm an avid consumer of science fiction, with a special soft spot for all things cyberpunk. Oh, and I just recently began reading comics. Better late than never, right?</p>

<p>Vladimir Putin has not only invaded Ukraine, but he has begun an assault on the people in Ukraine's capital, Kiev.</p>
<p>Ukraine is viewed by the international community as entirely the victim in the current situation.</p>
<p>The entire free world is lining up against you.</p>
<p>Now imagine what is happening in Kiev as happening in Moscow - but instead of sending poorly armed and trained children to die, they are just sending missiles and bombs of all sizes.</p>
<p>To prevent this from happening, you must take to the streets or any channel you have the most influence with, and do everything in your power to contribute to the removal of Vladimir Putin.</p>

<h1>Дорогие русские люди</h1>
<p>Владимир Путин не только вторгся в Украину, но и начал наступление на людей в столице Украины Киеве.</p>
<p>Украина рассматривается международным сообществом исключительно как жертва сложившейся ситуации.</p>
<p>Весь свободный мир выстраивается против вас.</p>
<p>А теперь представьте, что происходит в Киеве, как это происходит в Москве - только вместо того, чтобы посылать на смерть плохо вооруженных и обученных детей, они просто посылают ракеты и бомбы всех размеров.</p>
<p>Чтобы этого не произошло, вы должны выйти на улицу или на любой канал, на который вы имеете наибольшее влияние, и сделать все, что в ваших силах, чтобы способствовать смещению Владимира Путина.</p>

slowly it took shape and got ready for fame<br/>
what started as a first step back in 89<br/></p>
<p>the web flew free an amazing 20 years ago<br/>
four prior years of development and then it was a go<br/>
just a title, content entry and a page was fine<br/></p>

<p>it has evolved far far from its meager start<br/>
growth has been so fast it wants a logarithmic chart<br/>
no longer one almost plain text language<br/></p>
<p>now to write a page I must choose<br/>
which of the many doctypes will be best to use<br/>
I’ll want RDFA if I am integrating with social media<br/></p>
<p>no longer just html version one<br/>
learning each new language is just so much fun<br/>
some languages have died and been superseded<br/></p>
<p>they live on in carefully maintained archives<br/>
they linger on in forgotten dust coat hard drives<br/>
indeed CERN has resurrected the very first public website<br/></p>
<p>I always use two languages at least<br/>
css can make everything a visual feast<br/>
while html provides the bones<br/></p>
<p>I always follow the standards the doctypes supply<br/>
I treat the the IETF RFCs like gods up on high<br/>
I’ve got the w3c validators on my bookmarks toolbar<br/></p>
<p>I code freehand just me and the code<br/>
Nothing that might obfuscate any node<br/>
Gives me power and control<br/></p>

Focused on front-end currently, but working in a company with lots of proprietary frameworks it tends to mean more focus on requirements honing and working directly with product. I do not work in machine learning but do have the responsibility of delivering massive amounts of data to our customers across visualizations and giant, configurable reports. I do interviews too and often train people for technical interview prep as a hobby (i.e. not for hire, not endorsed by my parent company, not with any structure or rhyme or reason, but happy to help). I am most familiar with Java and Javascript and aspire to learn C++ as done at Google, and Python.</p>

<p>I am also a part time masters student at Columbia studying computer science, with a likely focus on Machine Learning.</p>

<p><strong>Being engaged:</strong> I aspire to be an approachable person politically but will admit I have found a lot to oppose in our new president :) so I focus on training progressives to engage in constructive political dialogue, including such forgotten skills as ""listening,"" ""not calling people racist when you don't know what else is wrong with their viewpoint"" and so forth. I get plenty of practice with my own family and some of my peers! But really, we went astray with trolling Internet arguments and shouting matches at family gathering. Black lives do matter, but I personally can forgive someone if they need to sit down and talk about why and have some, ahem, skeptical questions.</p>

<p><strong>Misc hobbies</strong>: Aspiring rock climber. Mostly I complain about my climbing gym but have great access to Central Park and have followed in the Gunks. I believe in productivity-as-a-hobby and focus on writing, messing around with bullet journals, etc.</p>

<p>Adding an additional answer even if there are valid answers can still add value to the collection of answers and questions we are building here. (A late answer does, by it's nature, get not much attention, so it leads to exceptionally low reputation per answer. But hey, that's life, right?)
And I feel it's the important thing here: We're answering professional questions in a professional way, and often do that quickly. That's of great value for the general public.</p>

<p>But the real thing of value, that is of value hard to describe in simple terms, is the body of text, the whole collection that we are creating here together. All participants here, whether he or she cares more about asking, answering or collecting questions and answers.</p>

<p>Other than that I can say I like helping others out with what I know and I'm always willing to learn.</p>

<p><strong>Hi! I'm Jeff.</strong> I am currently a tech lead on Google Maps Platform (Android, iOS, and Javascript SDKs) in Mountain View, CA, though my opinions and advice are my own. In my personal time, I enjoy lindy hop swing dancing, photography, aviation (as a private pilot), and organizing furry conventions.</p>
<p>Though I like helping with any answers I can, I am found most often on StackOverflow. I particularly like helping debug and explain <strong>Guice</strong>, <strong>Dagger</strong>, and <strong>Mockito</strong>, which I count as some of the most-powerful (and sometimes least-intuitive) packages available in Java today.</p>
<p>My five favorite computer science inventions: Code-generating serialization layers (Protocol Buffers and Thrift), Bloom filters, Hilbert indexes, A* search, and CompactHashSet. I'm also a fan of DI and mocking frameworks, as you can see above. :)</p>

25149,3908836,115,0,0,0,Ooker,,,https://lyminhnhat.com/A1,"<p>Hi! Welcome to my profile. My work can be divided into two projects: <em>The Sphere</em> and <em>A theory of perspective</em></p>
<h2>Project 1: The Sphere</h2>
<p>The mission of <em>The Sphere</em> is to promote self-refection, the respect to others, the curiosity to what causes fear, and the courage to cut harmful things. The targets are people who are suffering (or creating suffering to others), yet resist others' supports to maintain status quo. This includes abusers and people who developed a worldview to justify their learned helplessness. The method is to equip their friends and loved ones the skills and knowledge to help them change their mind. For starter, read about <a href=""https://www2.slideshare.net/esahakyan/integrated-social-services-reaching-the-most-vulnerable-training-package-for-case-managers-16096590"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">social work case management</a> and <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">consequentialism</a>.</p>
<p>Protectors of autonomy usually have a misconception that one's choice should always be respected, because their autonomy should always be respected. The fact is that it is only true in 99.999999% of cases, and the other 0.0000001% is people who internalized oppression. Therefore, only hoping for the best but leaving their situation intact is generally considered as undermining their autonomy. For starter, read about <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-autonomy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">relational autonomy</a> and <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/decision-capacity"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">decision-making capacity</a>.</p>
<p>This project is written in Vietnamese. <a href=""https://xn--qucu-hr5aza.com/?utm_source=SE%20%C2%BB%20Other%20sites%20Profile&amp;utm_medium=Homepage&amp;utm_campaign=Homepage"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Its website</a> attracted ~30k people in past year (~160 on average per day). Many of them are human right activists, psychologists, religion practitioners, academic researchers, artists, etc.</p>
<h2>Project 2: A theory of perspective</h2>
<p>Imagine a floating iceberg. The part above the water is the <em>The Sphere</em> project. The part below the water is this project. It is to construct a theory for the concept &quot;perspective&quot;, as in &quot;keep a fresh perspective&quot;, &quot;look at the problem in a new perspective&quot;, &quot;put yourself in other's perspective&quot;, etc. The concept is intuitive, but exactly what it is is still vague. Because of that, these advices are easier said than done. The take-home message is this &quot;formula&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Challenging assumption = meaning shifting = perspective changing</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>For more detail you can read the <a href=""https://lyminhnhat.com/research-proposal/?utm_source=SE%20%C2%BB%20Other%20sites%20Profile&amp;utm_medium=Research%20proposal&amp;utm_campaign=Perspectives"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">research proposal</a>. You can also read <a href=""https://lyminhnhat.com/a-theory-of-perspective-full-text/?utm_source=SE%20%C2%BB%20Other%20sites%20Profile&amp;utm_medium=A%20theory%20of%20perspective&amp;utm_campaign=Perspectives"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the theory itself</a>, but I should warn you that this is not a final product.</p>
<p>Thank you for your visit, and I hope you enjoy them. Have a nice day.</p>

<p>I'm a self-taught programmer (dabbled a bit around 12, but didn't really get started until two years later) that just wants to get to know more about web development and computers in general. Despite this, I <em>hate</em> school (can't really learn there).</p>

<p>Currently I'm proficient in the following languages:</p>

<ul>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>Python</li>
</ul>

<p>Right now, I'm learning Rust, with a bit of C on the side so I can understand how to use pointers better.</p>

<p>Having said that, some of the languages considering to in the future are:</p>

<ul>
<li>C#</li>
<li>Haskell</li>
<li>Racket</li>
<li>Lua</li>
</ul>

<p>Some random stuff:</p>

<h1>Why we're here</h1>

<p>The vision of Stack Exchange is important, and worth fighting for; our fight is not against each other, but against stagnation and fatigue. Do not become weary of doing well; and do not become content with your personal best!</p>

<p>If you're new, reach deep, learn (and then teach), and do more. If you're senior, train up others to complement or succeed you. Above all, let us celebrate our success! We're a community of competent, driven scholars: we have the best questions <em>and</em> the best answers!</p>

<h1>Why I'm here</h1>

<p>I like to think I am sharing in the experience of others here on Stack Exchange. I search for the perspective of others; and I take away value each time I visit; in turn, I hope to shape the experience of others in a positive way: by giving useful feedback, cajoling newcomers into constructive creators, and reminding senior members to continue giving the best of their experience&nbsp;&mdash; and the benefit of doubt.</p>

<h1>Who I am</h1>

<p>I recently discovered photography, and used a couple mirrors to take a selfie of taking a selfie. (Thus, my avatar.) As you can see, I'm always looking for a new creative outlet, and I enjoy puns entirely too much! My variety of hobbies (ranging from needlepoint to theatre) makes me relatable to a wide variety of persons: if I haven't tried it already, then I plan to at some point, and you're the perfect person to introduce me to it!</p>

<p><strong>About <em>Me</em></strong></p>
<p><code>Me</code> is a <em>reserved name</em> (you can't have a variable by that name) that refers to something that can only exist at run-time in a procedure's scope: the <em>current object</em>. Under the hood, when you make a member call to <code>DoSomething</code> against a <code>Class1</code> object, the call goes essentially like this:</p>
<pre><code>Set obj = New Class1
Class1.DoSomething obj
</code></pre>
<p>This means <code>DoSomething</code> looks like this in VBA:</p>
<pre><code>Public Sub DoSomething()
End Sub
</code></pre>
<p>But VBA sees it like this:</p>
<pre><code>Public Sub DoSomething(ByVal Me As Class1)
End Sub
</code></pre>
<p>That makes <code>Me</code> an implicit locally-scoped <code>ByVal</code> parameter of type <code>Class1</code>, and inside the <code>DoSomething</code> scope it holds a reference to whatever object <em>the caller</em> is currently using.</p>

new things. My major interests recently are programming models and methods
for concurrency/async, esp. <em>testing</em> things involving concurrency/async, applications
of functional programming, and doing interesting things with Mathematica.</p>
<p>Also, I have an unreasonable affection for certain computer languages.  Including
Spitbol, C++, Self, Scheme, awk, FORTH, Erlang, J, Smalltalk, Logo, BLISS, Haskell, and Algol 68.</p>
<p>(And there are a couple I hate with the heat of 1000 O-type stars: XSLT, TeX (considered as a language).  I'm not fond of Perl, either. But maybe just with the heat of a few dozen O-type stars.)</p>
<p>FYI, when it comes to coding standards I only have two firm rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>No hard tabs (<code>'\t' == '\x09'</code>) in files.</li>
<li>Files end with a newline.</li>
</ol>
<p>Other than those two rules, I'll go with whatever the team wants.  (Life's too short to worry about it.)</p>

34367,964831,471,6,0,1,Jerry Dodge,"Louisville, KY",,http://www.jerrydodge.com,"<p>I'm a Delphi developer. I work for a software company which does solutions for retail management, including inventory, POS, reporting, BI, Tags, and more. It's been in Delphi since Delphi's been around.</p>

<p>I am actively in Stack Overflow monitoring the <code>Delphi</code> tag, and looking for those questions I can answer and also contributing my time to keep Stack Overflow in order. I'm not an expert in anything, a jack of all trades rather. But I love to help people when I'm able to.</p>

<p>I've known Delphi since about 2007 now, and before that, I had learned VB6. I havn't gone back to VB since I learned Delphi. I also taught myself QBasic and HTML as a kid. It hasn't been until the past 5 years that I've been diving into programming.</p>

<p>Since then I've also become vaguely familiar with ASP.NET with C#, as well as some C# windows apps. But I'm not too fond of the whole .NET idea. .NET is good for web platforms and such, but not for win apps.</p>

<p>My latest work has been with Delphi XE10 Seattle mobile development. I'm still very raw on the subject, but see a huge potential behind it.</p>

<p>My strengths:</p>

<ul>
<li>Understanding the bigger picture of projects</li>
<li>Writing Custom Classes, Components, and Controls</li>
<li>Code organization (within unit or namespace)</li>
<li>Writing purely independent classes (as opposed to cross-referencing units or namespaces)</li>
<li>User Friendly UI's</li>
<li>Developer Friendly Classes</li>
<li>Encapsulating layers of business logic</li>
</ul>

<p>My weaknesses:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lower-level coding (such as Assembly)</li>
<li>Platform-specific design (using Firemonkey)</li>

<p>Started programming in the late 80's. I went to school but I consider myself to be primarily self-taught and I prefer not being pigeonholed as a certain type of developer. The term full-stack developer is ok since we need something to describe the idea but I don't think the term fully embodies the hacker spirit of wanting to learn everything about everything. As such I'm not afraid to get out of my areas of expertise.</p>

<p>I tend to focus on the SQL questions because I find them easiest to answer with the knowledge I carry around in my head without having to mess with compilers and a bunch of environment setup. Incidentally a good developer should be able to understand a lot of code straight off the printed page, without needing to see it run; however, that's not to say you should post a question without sufficient information to answer it.</p>

Twenty-eight year old Northwest native and internet nomad. My childhood was spent on a computer playing Half-life, Counter-Strike, Starcraft and other utterly nerd type games. Over time I looked to coding and web development in my early years as I was fortunate enough to have access to a computer and the internet. Today I find myself with a middle class income with a lack of time to fuel my passion of entrepreneurship. I have a reputable business presence in telecommunications, web development, real estate, business start ups and project management. </p>

<p>The real problem behind the ""not for extensive discussions"" thing is probably that some answers on some subsites tries to appear formal and complete, while in fact, nobody knows an ideal answer. It could be still understandable on Workspace, but obviously horrible on Parenting. Answers on some other websites that nobody ever wanted a discussion usually tries to appear informal to acknowledge that ""this might not be the perfect answer, but hope it has helped you a bit"". On the other hand, they are more permissive to personal opinions and duplicates, instead, as a result. Alternatively, they simply don't have a commenting feature, but visible downvotes, to acknowledge that this answer is not verified by many.</p>

Since then I have branched out to cloud services and managed IT services. </p>

<p>In late 2015 I moved to central VA with my wife and kids to be closer to her family and where she grew up. It has been an interesting transition from the city life to the country life...still getting used to hearing cows moo randomly throughout the day! I transferred my company to VA and have started working in the local community and surrounding areas providing IT services. I have also started a little homestead farm and am looking forward to the coming spring so we can plant our gardens. </p>

<p>While not well versed in the country life, I do have a lot of experience with life in general, working in the construction and electrical fields before deciding to follow IT as a career. I will do my best to provide advise on topics I have experience with from work and life!</p>

<p>I like Go, as a statically typed C-style-OOP systems programming language, but it doesn't have generics, and doesn't encourage functional practices. D encourages functional programming, proper OOP and fixes the problems of C and Go while being a better C++, and more productive / less dumb than Java.</p>

<p>While I love Python, it feels too mundane; for everyday tasks I prefer <a href=""http://racket-lang.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Racket</a> and <a href=""http://factor-lang.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Factor</a>.</p>

Students can make any live project on the programming language which they are studying. Some of my students say that after getting knowledge from me they started loving programming and they can create some innovative things on their own with programming. My students are basically from BCA, MCA, B. Tech, M.Tech pursuing students,  also industry professionals who want to get knowledge of programming languages which will help their career.</p>

<li>Oracle TimesTen is a monster. Holy crap though, it is blazingly fast.</li>
<li>Guice is a beast which should only be used when you never want people to know where data is coming from. It could be justified by testing, but for the love of all that is holy QUIT MAKING SO MANY MODULES. You need like, 3, for a medium-sized project.</li>
<li>Mockito is amazing &lt;3</li>
<li>MySQL performs like a drunken elephant, but it's free and easy to use. Also, it's workbench is very nice, and I like it.</li>
<li>It is frustrating that most Linux developers act like Linux is the default environment for computers. If Linux is so superior, then why can't it (or at least most of the main utilities for Linux) handle even the most basic crap like a CRLF? Why don't people make many good video games for it? Is it more secure, or do Linux users just tend to actually follow basic security protocols?</li>

There doesn't seem to be much good source material, the teaching (of assessed knowledge) is poor, and the questions asked for assessment have no real answers at all.</p>

<p>I'm also desperate to drag the pre-university teaching of electronics and computing way from 1970's hardware examples. I see students today learning with NE555, and 7805 - these components are as old as me, and are much less likely to be the correct choice. There are questions about pre-forming components - components are, in the main, now designed for automated pick-and-place, not wire-wrap and hand assembly.</p>

<hr />
<p>Prior to studying for a Masters degree in EE, I was a hobbyist in electronics and had been for many years - I started programming with Lego Mindstorms when I was little and slowly worked my way into building electronic kits and then on to designing circuits. I taught myself PCB design and much of the practical aspects of circuit design when digitising a model railway that I have on my windowsill (block detection, control of points, signals, etc.).</p>
<p>It wasn't until going to university that in being taught the fundamentals of circuit design and theory that I started having much more success with my hobby and am now turning that into a career in electronics. Having learnt to program in C/C++ during my first year at Uni, I moved on and taught myself to program in Verilog and work with FPGAs - digital logic circuitry being my main area of interest.</p>
<p>For my Masters year I developed an FPGA based data transfer system based around a low level PCIe IP core (Altera) and in the process taught myself how to write Windows KMDF drivers and DLLs. In fact this project landed me a job at Georgia Tech where I continued development of the system and have since turned it into a Ultrasound Imaging Platform which is configurable enough to be useful in many other research areas including medical research and industrial applications.</p>

49226,5944659,101,0,0,0,Eugene Str.,"Kyiv, Ukraine",,https://germanwordlist.wordpress.com/,"<p>I study German by reading German newspapers and learning words (26000 so far). My motto: If I can fluently read German newspapers, I can pretty much read anything in German. While most people study German from easy to hard, I started from hard outright: Opened a newspaper and began to read!</p>

<p>I studied German at school for 2 years and then took 2 German courses at university. That was back in the nineties. By February 2014 my German vocabulary had probably consisted of about 200 common words and phrases. And I had some basic understanding of German grammar.</p>

<p>It was at that time that I made a personal commitment to learn German. The plan was to become proficient in German in 6 months at the maximum. I figured out that if I learned 50 new words a day, in 6 months my vocabulary would equal roughly 9000 words. From the information I could find over the Internet at that time, it seemed that 9000 words would be more than enough to become nearly fluent in German. But the reality turned out to be quite different. Even today, with over 18600 words in my word list, I still write out 20-30 new German words per day (if I read for 4+ hours a day). </p>

<p>My approach is to learn German words that I write out from the German press. I think if one can more or less fluently read German newspapers, one will understand pretty much everything that he encounters in German. Learning words, in my opinion, can be compared to a tree trunk, with everything else (grammar, listening comprehension) being tree branches. I strongly doubt I would have achieved my current level of German had I pursued another learning path (e.g. attending German classes). Nonetheless, I still have a lot to do. </p>

<p>As part of my self-study program, I also daily listen to German radio (B5 aktuell) and German version of Euronews. When moving around Kyiv, I carry along a German grammar book that I regularly peruse. To start speaking in German I plan to start reading texts aloud (that's what Heinrich Schliemann--a guy who dug up ancient Troy in the 19th century and also a famous polyglot--did in his language studies). </p>

<p>My dream is to take and pass the C2 German language exam (highest level), without taking any of the previous exam levels. My current estimation is that successfully passing the exam would be possible when my word list stands at about 28000-30000 words.</p>

by taking my own conclusions and experience gathered from other people. So some

not arrive at the conclusion that I actually follow or condone behavior described

51155,367500,101,0,0,0,Scott Severance,"Dallas, Texas, USA",,http://www.scottseverance.us,"<p>My first Linux experience was in 1998 (via telnet into my university's server to read my email with PINE). I've run Linux on my own machines off and on since 1999 and exclusively since 2006.</p>

<p>My first distro was Slackware, which I quickly broke. I then went back to Windows 95. After that, my friend helped me install Debian, which I used until I replaced that machine. I found Debian too difficult to install on my own, so I put Red Hat on my newer machine. At that time, <code>yum</code> didn't exist, and Red Hat only offered updates if I logged in to X as root, which I rarely did. So, it quickly became outdated, and OpenOffice 1.1 couldn't handle right-to-left text, which I needed for one of my university classes. So, I started using my Windows XP laptop most of the time. I couldn't install Linux on the laptop because the NTFS tools of the era couldn't resize my partition.</p>

<p>After a couple of years, I decided to switch my Red Hat box to something more modern. I wanted to move away from the RPM package format, so I tried installing Debian again and once again found it too complicated to get all the features I needed. Then, I read about an up and coming Debian-based distro called Ubuntu that had just released their latest version. So, I installed 6.06 (Dapper Drake) and have used Ubuntu exclusively as my main OS all my machines since that time. I only boot into Windows a few times a year. I've tried a few other distros' live CDs, but so far have always decided that the benefits of those distros aren't significant enough for me to switch over.</p>

<p>For the first many years, I used the command line most of the time, as early Linux GUIs weren't up to many basic tasks. These days, the GUI tools have made leaps and bounds and are quite usable. Nevertheless, I often prefer the command line for many tasks. I'm much more likely to use <code>vim</code> than Gedit. But, I quite appreciate GUI tools for a number of tasks--perhaps most tasks these days.</p>

Cellio, <a href=""https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5193"">was terminated without warning</a> and <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/334133"">portrayed to the
press as misgendering trans people</a> by Stack Overflow, Inc. All
signs suggest this was an erroneous, if not malicious, decision not
founded on fact, which the company is completely failing to take any
responsibility for. <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/333965"">This has caused an enormous and ongoing uproar in
the community.</a></p>

<p>Monica and the community have been quite literally <strong>begging</strong> for
<em>some</em> kind of response from the company either opening up a path to reinstatement, or justifying their decision to terminate her, for more
than a month now. She's made many good-faith offers to talk, and
others have offered to mediate (and made <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=monica"">dozens of constructive
suggestions on how to resolve the situation</a>). Several members of the
Lavender community have spoken up on her behalf, e.g. in <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/336731"">this prominent post</a>.</p>

<p>So far, Stack Overflow, Inc. has met all of this with thunderous
silence. As a long-time contributor and someone always willing to see
the good in the company's and its employees' actions and assume good
faith, I'm still struggling to come to terms with the corporate
callousness of this behaviour which we have to assume now is the new
normal.</p>

<p><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/336526"">Having exhausted all other means of communication,</a> Monica is now
raising funds for potential legal action to clear her name. This is in
her own interest, but arguably also in the interest of the SO
community at large. While only the libel is likely to be legally
actionable, it might establish at least <em>some</em> boundaries to what the
company can do to its volunteers, as well as be a symbolic slap in the
face of a business that appears to have lost all respect for the
community that keeps it alive.</p>

<p>I have complete trust the funds will be used well and anything left
over (say because they decide to do the right thing after all and
legal action becomes unnecessary) will go toward good causes. </p>

<p><strong><a href=""https://www.gofundme.com/f/stop-stack-overflow-from-defaming-its-users"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Consider supporting her today.</a></strong></p>

<p>Chairman, CEO and Founder of The Dosaygo Corporation</p>

<h3>Places I’ve Worked</h3>

<p>I’ve consulted for OB1 Company are building a permissionless bitcoin marketplace built atop the blockchain and IPFS. You can see my contributions for them at this github account. I enjoyed it but ultimately I couldn’t contribute more because of IP conflicts with an existing project. Plus the timezone difference. 6am meetings are pretty much too early, for USD 6667 a month.</p>

<p>I worked in Ireland under the Startup Entrepreneur Programme prototyping work for what would become Project Ant with my company, Dosaygo.</p>

<p>I consulted in web development for HKD 60,000 a month in Hong Kong, building e-commerce websites on a big platform for bankers hobby projects that ultimately morphed into other things.</p>

<p>I worked as a research assistant at the National Academy of Sciences in Taiwan, and some of the things I built included lots of graph visualization, code and images of which you can see here.</p>

<p>I once turned down an USD 12,000 a month contract building disease monitoring apps in Africa with an NGO because I was overbooked.</p>

<p>A long time ago I worked in technical support for a very large support services supplier.</p>

<h3>What I’m doing now.</h3>

<p>I’m starting my tiny company, and launching a handful of products. I’m also available for some consulting gigs. Let me know what you’re looking for.</p>

<p>iOS developer and team lead with over 5 years' experience developing and shipping mobile applications in the banking sector.</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>Born and raised in Australia, I received a Bachelor of Electronic and Computer Engineering from Griffith University, Brisbane, Australia. After graduating, I immigrated to Paraguay where I took a developer job in software. </p>

<p><strong>Experience</strong></p>

<p>I have over 5 years at my current employer where I begun as a developer and moved to a team lead after the first year. During the ensuring years I have maintained a very hands-on development role where I implemented significant portions of dozens of apps, and coded a couple of complete apps from start to finish.</p>

<p>From a project management perspective, I am responsible for complete projects including project definition, requirements analysis, architecture, development, quality assurance, deployments, and publication of apps to the App Store and Play Store. I also maintain legacy projects written in Objective-C (some that I myself developed) for iOS.</p>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>I'm a Software Engineer with a strong interest in Data Engineering, Data Analysis and Web Development. I have around 5 years of professional/academic experience mainly with Python language.
At Stack Overflow I usually be active in <a href=""/questions/tagged/python"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;python&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;python&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""python-container"">python</a> and <a href=""/questions/tagged/pandas"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;pandas&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;pandas&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""pandas-container"">pandas</a> tags.</p>
<p>I have worked mainly with <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Pandas</strong>, <strong>Django Rest Framework</strong>, <strong>PyQT</strong>, <strong>SQL</strong> and <strong>GIT</strong>. I think of the programming language is not the most important thing, what really matters is the fundamentals (OOP, SOLID, Design Patterns, Agile methodologies, logical bases). I try to apply those concepts daily.</p>
<p>Sometimes I write Javascript code, you know, there are situations where you must wear the front-end suit .</p>
<p>You can find me in the following places:</p>

<p>Here is another short list, a list of pet peeves I have collected on Stack Overflow and related websites:</p>

<h2>SI units</h2>

<p>To avoid ambiguities, there is a general consensus on how to format physical units. Please try to follow them, it helps the flow when reading, and it helps when trying to understand exactly what you are talking about. The official guidelines are offered in chapter 5 of the <a href=""http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SI brochure</a>, but there is a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#Unit_symbols_and_the_values_of_quantities"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">summary</a> with a couple of examples on Wikipedia.</p>

<p>A particular problem is the <em>space</em> between the value and the unit, for example: 12&#8239;V, not 12V. A common hack is to use the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-breaking_space"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">non-breaking space</a>, <code>&amp;nbsp;</code>, to prevent the browser wrapping the line between the value and the unit. The problem with <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> is that it is often interpreted as a <em>fixed width</em> space, meaning that it will not render as the same width as a normal space, but wider. Unicode has solved this problem by introducing the <code>NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE</code> symbol, <code>&amp;#8239;</code>.</p>

<p>My recommendation is that you use <code>&amp;#8239;</code> to format SI units. This difference may or may not be visible in your browser:</p>

<ul>
<li>12 V (normal space)</li>
<li>12&nbsp;V (&amp;nbsp;)</li>
<li>12&#8239;V (&amp;#8239;)</li>
</ul>

<h2><em>""I'm in Europe.""</em></h2>

<p>This means <em>nothing</em>. Nothing at all to anyone trying to help you with a question you might have. Either write your <em>country</em>, or just leave it out - There's a world of difference (literally) between Turkey, Switzerland, Portugal, Romania, United Kingdom and Iceland. Different laws, different business structures, different traditions, different standards. The same goes for Asia.</p>

<p>Leaving out your country means that you will not get help with questions such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is this legal?</li>
<li>Where can I buy things?</li>
</ul>

<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I am a Computer Science M. Sc. student (they/them). My research interests are knowledge representation and processing of math, and lately also programming language theory.</p>
<p>I contribute to the <a href=""https://uniformal.github.io/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MMT project</a> (<a href=""https://github.com/UniFormal/MMT"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">UniFormal/MMT on GitHub</a>), a larger research software written in Scala which lets you formalize a broad range of formal knowledge: math, logic, type theory, and foundations. MMT and many of its algorithms are <a href=""https://kwarc.info/people/frabe/Research/rabe_future_15.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">foundation-independent</a>: with bare MMT, you don't even have natural numbers, let alone functions. The beauty is versatility; the challenge generality.</p>
<p>For more info and publications, see my <a href=""https://kwarc.info/people/nroux/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">academic website</a> and <a href=""https://navid-roux.netlify.app/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">personal website</a>.</p>
<p>More hobby-wise, I am dabbling in the <a href=""https://coq.inria.fr/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Coq Proof Assistant</a> and, e.g., formalized my own flavor of <a href=""https://github.com/ComFreek/basic-ontology-language"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">an ontology language</a> and <a href=""https://github.com/ComFreek/lambda-coq"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a lambda calculus with de Bruijn indices</a>.</p>
<p>Programming-wise, I also fancy the latest TypeScript/ECMAScript. And I like <a href=""https://github.com/ComFreek/mmtpygments"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">writing/autogenerating syntax highlighters</a> that <a href=""https://comfreek.github.io/mmtpygments/mmtpygments/test/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">succeed on over 15k lines of code</a>.</p>
<p>Feel free to reach out (by posting an <a href=""https://github.com/ComFreek/ComFreek/issues/new"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">issue here</a>)! I always love hearing and chatting about cool things.</p>

<p>Ever since then, I have always enjoyed working with people who love programming and love sharing their skills: no matter the job title, be it Software Engineer, Scrum Master or Solutions Developer, I enjoy workdays the most when someone in my team is learning something new (especially when that someone is me!).</p>

<p>My strongest suit is C++ development, but as time goes on I find more and more tools that I enjoy trying out and using to solve the challenge I'm facing at the moment. There is no language or tool that is too daunting when one is surrounded by a team that loves learning and sharing.</p>

I have graduated from the University of Rostock with a MSc in Informatics.</p>

<p>I try to be friendly. I do not always succeed. I try to be correct. I do not always succeed in that either. Should you see me failing at either of these, please point them out to me so I can better myself.</p>

<p>Programming wise I'm particularly fond of functional programming in general and Haskell in particular, but I believe you can have some amount of fun with nearly all programming languages, even the ones people love to hate such as C++ or Java (C++ in particular has a lot of nice things hidden behind historically accumulated cruft and bad code).</p>

<p>Aside from programming, software engineering and everything surrounding that I also enjoy reading books, board and video games as well as good food. I am also fond of discussing a lot of things that follow in the realms of sociology, philosophy or religion and miscellaneous technology and the sciences, although I have no formal training in any of those.</p>

<p>I am fluent in English and German. I hope to acquire more language skills as I go.</p>

While my job was based more on networking &amp; radios and didn't really have much to do with programming, my AIT instructor was familiar with C+ and that's ultimately where I became interested in the subject.</p>

<p>I am big into RC aircraft and embedded programming.  Very fun stuff.  I'm an aeronautical engineer, but I also do a lot with electronics, electrical engineering, and computer science/programming (including a lot with C/C++ in Arduino and some lower-level AVR code).

<p>I have no problem with ye using whichever third-person pronouns address me that you want, <em>so long as it is comprehensible</em>.  A person using a niche and specialised word has only hitself to blame when hoi polloi don't understand it.</p>

<p>Language is first, and foremost, about <strong>communication</strong>, and everything else should take a backseat to that.  If a specific form of ""Modernising"", ""Evolving"" or ""Politically Correctness"" get in the way of that, then <em>that form needs</em> to be taken back to basics - not shoved through willy-nilly.  </p>

<p>Sometimes just looking back in history will turn up a perfectly suitable deprecated word for an idea that just fell out of usage - try giving some of those a dust off before inventing new ones.</p>

<p>Keep calm, carry on, be excellent to each other, and - most importantly - take a moment to accept who you are and reflect on how you measure you self-worth, instead of just blindly accepting society's yammering that people need to be ""beautiful"", ""rich"" or ""famous"" to be happy.</p>

I appreciate that you value my take on matters, but it's incredibly rude to be asking such -- from someone you don't know, and someone who is not offering such, for free -- when I'm busy as-is. I offer my spare time here when it pleases me, but after taking or teaching classes I generally need a break.</em></p>
<p><em>If you need math help, use <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/"">Math Stack Exchange</a> or the <a href=""https://discord.gg/math"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mathematics Discord server</a>, please. Don't bug unwilling people individually.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>MSE's resident Pokémon nerd, graduate student in mathematics, and lover of pineapple on pizza. </p>
<p>Aside from stuff pertaining to MSE, I occasionally speedrun (<a href=""https://www.speedrun.com/user/PrincessEev"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">profile</a>) or grind on RetroAchievements (<a href=""https://retroachievements.org/user/PrincessEev"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">profile</a>), and run a Pokémon-themed community Discord server with over 20,000 members (<a href=""https://discord.me/eeveemd"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">invite</a>). I also occasionally can be seen poking around other Stack Exchange sites (math is my specialty though), VGMaps, Pokémon Showdown, and spend a large time watching YouTube videos in a variety of STEM subjects or video games.</p>
<p>So far academically, I graduated from undergrad in the spring of 2019 and currently am in grad school. I also study topics on my own a fair bit, especially over breaks; recently, I've been studying from Apostol's <em>Introduction to Analytic Number Theory</em>. I still feel have a long way to go before I can call myself a &quot;master&quot; of any sort of mathematics, but if nothing else I feel like I have a quite broad knowledge pool that's stoked more interests than I can reasonably pursue in my lifetime.</p>
<p>Currently my personal inclinations lie towards algebraic topics (e.g. abstract algebra, category theory) but I've had quite an extensive look in analytic topics due to my coursework (especially real analysis, measure theory, functional analysis, and PDE theory). Ultimately, though, all math is cool and beautiful and I have a deep appreciation for all of it.</p>

<h1>Pronouns: She/Her/Hers (but I don't mind they/them -- don't stress out!)</h1>

<p><strong>I approve of using indicated pronouns; I disapprove of SE (1) firing a Jewish Moderator right before high holidays with no notice and (2) slandering her as a bigot in newspapers.</strong></p>

<p>I just am trying to make it easier to document our organization-specific applications for JAWS users (a screen-reader), MAGic users (a screen magnifier), and Dragon Command Users (often mobility impaired users).   Most of our end-users are keyboard-only. </p>

<p>We're normally stuck in Microsoft Office, but we are expanding to some DAISY Digital Audio Book format (See <a href=""http://www.daisy.org/z3986/structure/SG-DAISY3/part2-major.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.daisy.org/z3986/structure/SG-DAISY3/part2-major.html</a>)</p>

<p>My goal is to simplify the documentation process by improving our templates, creating macros,  and automating anything possible!</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>(Oh, and I'm a HUGE fan of <strong>Wildbow's <a href=""https://parahumans.wordpress.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Worm</a>/<a href=""https://www.parahumans.net/about/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ward</a></strong> webserials , but none of my friends in real life are into it.

<hr>

<p>I'm working on my ""podcast empire"" -- as of today (May 7, 2019), things are still being migrated &amp; set up, but 2 major portions coming into being are 1) <strong>Alphabetical April</strong> (5 minute writing snippets) and 2) <strong>Pact</strong> (by wildbow) <em>Liveread</em> and <em>Audiobook</em>.   The Liveread is Tuesdays/Thursdays, 8PM EDST on <strong><a href=""http://mixlr.com/write-o-rama"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://mixlr.com/write-o-rama</a></strong> (archived on the showreel on Mixlr, but also distributed (soon) as a regular podcast.  The Edited Audiobook will be a few weeks delayed behind that, but also a podcast.  </p>

<p>Update as of Oct 1 -- Depression strikes again -- no updates, only one episode of ABC April is out. Sorry.<br>
<em>Update Oct 24: And apparently I lost my URL -- depression = missing renewal deadlines. sigh.</em></p>

<p>My name is Jeroen, I'm a student doing a programming course. I am interested in everything technology related. Including Linux.</p>
<p>Currently I've made a dozen websites in HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP and Node.JS and I've made a few C# programs, a lot of little Java projects and I have been tinkering with C and Python with GTK+.</p>
<p>I am an advocate of open source software. Because of this I have been using Linux as my primary desktop for about 4 years now. I have been everywhere in the Linux world, all from Ubuntu to Arch Linux and from Arch Linux to Linux From Scratch. Currently I have been settled on elementary OS (an Ubuntu based distribution) because of it's simplicity (programmers like simple things too :P)</p>

85979,13708584,101,0,0,0,Iñaki Viggers,,,http://www.OneClubOfJusticides.com,"<p>My primary purpose in law.stackexchange.com is to share with you my expertise and experience in U.S. law &amp; litigation so that others (oftentimes, including your own attorney) will have a harder time in their quest to harm or defraud you. I represented myself in court, and so can you. I am here to help you.</p>

<p>In 2015, I was victim of a pattern of unlawful activity that was abetted by various directors and managers of the <a href=""http://president.umich.edu/about/mission/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">University of Michigan</a>, my former workplace. I made the thoughtful decision to commence judicial proceedings without an attorney. During my legal research, I learned of cases about other people who also have been unlawfully harmed by the very institutions which are supposedly dedicated to the improvement of our civilization: universities, churches, and courts.</p>

<p>Indeed, litigation <em>in pro per</em> gave me first-hand knowledge of the tremendous extent and blatancy of judicial corruption. Many injured innocents --unbeknownst to them because they retain an attorney-- are deprived of their rights by inept officers who wear a black robe and prefix their name with the misleading and ironic word ""Honorable"" (or ""Justice"", if the crook runs his or her dealings in a supreme court).</p>

<p>But judicial debauchery should not discourage you from litigating your matters. One benefit of pursuing your meritorious claims in court is the ability to obtain evidence (and identify case law) with which you will prove to anyone else that the truth and the law are on your side despite justice being denied. Others will be grateful that your evidence serves them as a warning to avoid those same perpetrators.</p>

<p>Youtube channel <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxupmJwDHkCwI4zg2PxEPnA"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">One Club Of Justicides</a> contains videos that may be of interest to people who consider representing themselves in court. There I explain various legal concepts and doctrines along with my litigation experience, point to resources for pro se litigants' legal research, give a closer look as to what judicial proceedings entail, and pinpoint instances where unbecoming judges and lawyers attempt to deceive and/or abuse pro se litigants.</p>

<p>I got a B.S. degree in Applied Mathematics (Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México), a masters degree in Mechanical Engineering (Iowa State University), an actuarial background attested by several exams at the Society Of Actuaries and the Casualty Actuarial Society, and several years of experience as systems analyst and database consultant.</p>

<pre><code>Ladies and Gentlemen,
hobos and tramps.
Cross-eyed mosquitos
and bow-legged ants.
Pull up a chair,
and sit on the floor,
I’ll tell you a story
you’ve heard before

One bright day
in the middle of the night
two dead boys
got into a fight
they stood back to back
and faced each other
pulled out to guns
and stabbed each other
a deaf policeman heard the noise
pulled out a knife
and shot both boys
If you don’t believe me
this lie is true
just ask the blind man –
he saw it too!

90694,13111119,97,13,0,3,Mr. de Silva,"Sri Lanka, Canada",,,"<p>I started learning electronics when I was 13. Started 'messing' with computers because they were cool electronics gadgets (certified as a Radio Electronics technician {built my own three band radio and stereo} at age 13). A neighbour would give me old punch cards used by the IBM mainframes at the airport. Got a whole lot of old IBM stuff from ARAMCO. In 1982 I purchased a Sinclar ZX-81 and started programming in Z80A assembler and all Sinclair, and later AMSTRAD machines. Developed systems in PICK for U.K. Company. In 1989 started my first business building technology systems (software and hardware), tech departments and tech companies for Entrepreneurs. Have built TV stations, VOIP busineses and systems, Coca Cola/Pepsi high tech machinery, VIDEOJET, etc, etc. Came to Canada in 2009 - built a GSM company and some other stuff. Truth be told - I have done much more tech work in other countries than Canada (Canada is not that big on local innovation/enterprise). Since 2009, have been investing and developing a programming language, platform and db system which is an extremely advanced system...</p>

<p>Used the Internet at IBM before the Internet was a thing, in 1990... :) (my company owned the IBM building and we were building a TV station. IBM people gave us access to their 'internet' connection to search for equipment).</p>

<p>Have worked on every major OS since 1981... will be 100% linux soon (our servers are currently CentOS). By next year all desktops will be replaced by Linux 100%. The 'popular' desktops are way too intrusive/annoying/slow and STALE.</p>

<p>My highly educated Daughter, my Son and another highly educated individual is now taking over my businesses, my wife and I are slowly becoming mentors and advisors.</p>

93281,1434396,101,0,0,0,Tschallacka,"Kleef, Duitsland",,https://www.tschallacka.de,"<p>In the summer of '99 I started to become more interested in the programs that made the computers run and my father bought me a couple of books on programming and I started reading and experimenting with it. The hardest part was understanding how variables worked. This was in the time before you could go to the internet to answer any question because google didn't exist yet, and I didn't know where to look. I remeber vividly tossing the Java step by step book frustrated in a corner because it was that little understanding that hindered me from understanding the rest. It lay there for 4-6 months until suddenly, when I had all but forgotten about it it clicked in my head and I understood how variables worked. I got the book up and started reading, and suddenly I could understand how it worked, how it translated and a world opened for me.</p>
<p>The year that followed I learned, Java, Perl, HTML, JavaScript, C++, Visual Basic, PHP and possibly a few other programming languages I have forgotten about. It was the basis for my understanding the digital world. A couple of projects I remember making are a forum, a remake of pokemon in javascript with map creator, a room walk through like you happen to see on a lot of house buying websites, a direct x 7 game in C++, a book record keeper in java to keep track of the books I had.</p>
<p>From there I kept doing a couple of hobby projects off and on, started several relatively successful fora and stopped them when the trolls found them and turned the entire place toxic and stressful, had some websites for fun where I would gather jokes, that site had a lot of CSS things in it I had experimented with, another was to gather and display poems. I discontinued them at some point because I didn't wish to pay for the server costs anymore for sites that I rarely used anymore and didn't have that many users/visitors.</p>
<p>I was able to get a job at a company as a programmer and there my skills deepened by having more contact with other programmers and learning about other possibilities and how to cooperate with them, take the lead in some aspects, and follow the lead in others.
After that job I went on to another job where even more responsibility was put on my shoulder by transforming a static html site that was updated by frontpage into a dynamic responsive website, without a team to fall back on. This was a pretty challenging thing because I had to combine a lot of varied items into one coherent thing.</p>
<p>During these jobs I also started coding a Minecraft Mod, Magic Cookies and had great fun exploring how to expand Minecraft functionality with my ideas. Basically the entire mod is a test bed of me trying to see what is possible within Minecraft code. I had great fun figuring out how large structures are rendered like nether temples and recreated my own with my dark temple that spawns in the nether, the same way a nether structure does, without having to rely on chunks being loaded like normal spawning of buildings do.</p>

<p>I have a strong appetite for mission critical data-driven application &amp; infrastructure development in complex environments where horizontally and vertically scalable high-performance and/or high-availability play pivotal roles.</p>
<p>My interests in software development range from native applications and system level programming all the way up to web &amp; java based technology with C++ being my favorite language. Implementing database kernels, DSL compilers, analytical libraries and optimizing this stuff for specific use cases, hardware, operating systems and (cloud) infrastructure is what I consider Bread and Butter.</p>
<p>I am working for MonetDB Solutions where we help to maintain the open source column store MonetDB and facilitate commercial deployment and support.</p>
<p>Besides software development I still love learning about pure mathematical topics like how to generalize the Feynman-Kac and Itō formulae for stochastic processes defined on smooth manifold, but also applied topics like how backpropagation works in neural networks and how memory can be modeled using recurrent neural networks. And once I have some understanding of whatever I like to disseminate my knowledge through the art of teaching and mentoring.</p>

<p>By day now, I am a Project Manager in the Telecom world and don't get to do the fun stuff anymore, but I am a BSEE &amp; Telecommunications Engineer by trade and education, and the only formal programming training I have is in FORTRAN back in college.  I'm self learned in C#, VBA, and a little VB6 mixed in, and my next goal is to try to learn Java.</p>

<p>I'm always looking to know more about C#, LINQ, XML, and XSD, and throw in some SQL as well.</p>

<p>In my personal life, aside from my precious time with my family, I enjoy golf in addition to the aforementioned programming, as well as new technology.  I build computers once in a while and am running my own Home Theater PC.</p>

I've helped with the design of protocols and API's within international standardization bodies. Over 30 years of general experience with computers, starting with MSX Basic at an early age. I've developed in Java for as long as the language exists (Kotlin is looking good too). I consider myself a polyglot though, and have learned many computer languages since my Computer Science study.</p>
<hr />
<p>On the Crypto site I pride myself in giving easy to understand answers on questions relatively low on math. I'll never match the mathematical prowess of some of my peers, but a more practical answer is often called for. And as my picture indicates there isn't that much that escapes my attention. This also results in a relatively high amount of comments and edits. As of 2018 I got elected as moderator on the crypto site - which mainly means I have to keep re-evaluating myself, especially when it comes to closing questions.</p>

Reasonably good at photography, computer stuff, a wee bit of maths, physics.  Studied Making Stuff Up and Not Using Common Sense at the University of Civil Service and later watching lawyers avoid common sense like the plague.  Would ban lawyers if (when) gain complete domination of world, pardoning Judge Judy on the basis she's not totally detached from reality.  Addicted to chocolate.</p>
<ul>
<li>Favorite program : Canada's Worst Driver.</li>
<li>Favorite book : Either &quot;Tinker, Tailor, Spy&quot; by John le Carré or one of the Disc World novels by Terry Pratchett.</li>
<li>Favorite Food : Is there anything better than Pepperoni Pizza ?  Surely not.  Only Domino can screw this up - a blind monkey could do better than Domino Pizza.</li>
<li>Most surprised by : Suicide By BrExit</li>
<li>Favorite Music : Jazz piano, even the weird stuff.</li>
<li>Least Favorite Music : It's a toss up between Irish Country and Western and Christian Rock.</li>
<li>Baffled By : Humans.  Dogs I understand (like kids without the talking back), even cats (just about the most self centered creatures until they invented overpaid footie players).  Humans remain a mystery wrapped in a soft, squishy shell.</li>
<li>Favorite sport : Real Football (i.e. the one where you're supposed to <em>only</em> kick the ball with a few exceptions, not pick it up and run).</li>
<li>Least Favorite Sport : Golf.  At least doing it is exercise, but <em>watching it ?!?!</em></li>
<li>Favorite equation : The Ideal Gas Law - this thing just never stops being useful.</li>
<li>Religion : Devout and committed Atheist.</li>
<li>Politics : Democracy - keep it until we figure out something not as crazy.</li>
<li>Favorite Comedian : An impossible choice between the late Dave Allen and the surprisingly still alive Dara O'Brien.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bucket List :</p>
<ul>
<li>Clone Sigourney Weaver</li>
<li>Marry cloned Sigourney Weaver</li>
<li>Divorce cloned Sigourney Weaver</li>
<li>Clone Catherine Hicks</li>
<li>Live In Sin with clone of Catherine Hicks (lots and lots of sin)</li>
<li>Secretly think about cloned Sigourney Weaver while with cloned Catherine Hicks, but at least feel guilty about this.</li>
<li>Be sued jointly by real Catherine Hicks and real Sigourney Weaver for the cloning without permission thing.  Would that be theft or what ?</li>
<li>Die</li>

<p>I'm fairly confident I'll manage at least one of those.</p>

<p><strong>Need a smart, motivated, and hard-working desktop or embedded developer? <em>Hire me!</em></strong>
Send mail to my first name at codygray.com.</p>
<p>My deepest areas of expertise are the x86 microarchitecture and the Windows API, but my interests span multiple platforms and diverse disciplines. At work, I design, build, and maintain speciality embedded hardware and software to perform data-acquisition and real-time signal processing from sensors, primarily targeting the aerospace industry. These days, I mostly write code in C++ or assembly. I also know C, C#, VB.NET, VB 6, and a variety of shell-scripting languages. Passionate about developing robust, efficient systems.</p>
<p>I enjoy the challenge of solving problems and learn new things quickly. I've an excellent eye for quality and detail. I'm here because I find great reward in teaching others and because I want to make the Internet a better place.</p>
<p>Brevity is not my strong suit. <a href=""https://lifehacker.com/why-you-should-be-kind-instead-of-nice-1846124841"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Kind, not nice</a>. I have strong ideas and make a habit of openly challenging assumptions. People don't like having their assumptions challenged, so this sometimes leads to confrontation. Nothing I say is meant to offend; please don't take it personally. Progress cannot happen without confrontation, so think for yourself and question everything.</p>
